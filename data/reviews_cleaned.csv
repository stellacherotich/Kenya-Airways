0,"Not Verified |  The lady at check-in was very rude and insisted on wanting to check in my colleague on a 4am flight with no alternative accommodation but a mere 200usd and we  rejected the offer as it excluded accommodation. She refused to call the manager when we requested her to and brazenly carried on until we confronted her again. Only after waiting for 55 minutes then my colleague's seat was secured and we went through the boarding gates. As if that wasn't enough, the departure time was 30min late and no apology was received from the captain. To use Kenya Airways was the biggest blunder on my side ever committed.

1,"Dismal from start to end. Not all of the staff and crew were rude, some were just sullen and disinterested. Food was consistently awful, drinks were ok.

Food was horrible, and to make matters worse, they lost the entire passengers' luggage without any explanation.

All perishable items that I carried will now be trashed since the man said the earliest we could get our bags is Wednesday 8/24. A passenger on the same flight who had air tagged her luggage indicated that the bag was still at JKIA!

4,"JNB-NBO-AMS-ZRH on 14-15 August 23. Flights on time, despite being quite full. Good announcements. Check in on transfer desk in Jo-burg, all 3 BPs issued on spot. Kenya now uses the South African Airlines lounge, which is very high class lounge with sleepers and a very diverse buffet with high quality foods. The long haul flights were both on Boeing 787-9, business class is wonderfully furnished, spacious, in 2x2x2 configuration which is perfect. Low chair fenders allow you to overlook entire cabin when seated upright. Very ample leg space in the lie-flats. Spent night in Pride lounge, Nairobi. Preordered, hot seafood meals were provided thrice on the two flights, all different variants and tasty. Take-off champagne given. Not the most sublime business class catering in the skies: food in general is not extraordinary (apart from the pre-order options), no beer choices, only the watery national Tusker Lager offered. Meals robust and reliable, pre-ordered meal managed well. FAs active and smiley, though not well coordinated, despite being many. IFE is acceptable though narrow choices on movies. Nice beds with mattresses and pillows, 2 blankets per seat. Will fly again with KQ. KLMs 52 lounge in Amsterdam is huge and good, they printed out coming Boarding Passes for me. Amsterdam-Zurich on Embraer 190 aircraft operated by KLM, well synchronised with Kenya Airways and under their flight number. Flight full. Delayed ½ hour due to complicated, tedious loading of two giant dogs, a serious unnecessary delay causing delay for 200 people. Catering was surprisingly good: menu card, nice, large food box with 3 course meal, including my favoured seafood meal. Champagne, 4 wines, and lots of hot and soft drinks offered. Swift service.

5,Officially the worlds worst airline. 3hr + delay from SA to Burundi and coming home they call you to board and then tell you your flight is delayed by 2hrs+. No compensation. Rude cheeky staff with no customer service. They try to push the blame to customers and have a serious attitude issue. Everything about the airline is so disappointing from the aircraft to the meals to the staff to the compensation. Been on the airport for more than 10hrs. No empathy for ppl.

10,"We had flown in from Dubai to Nairobi on Business class and it was good. Hence on our way back I decided to upgrade and fly business class, expecting the same. It was the biggest mistake in my life. The so called business class was just close to the premium economy of most other airlines. Seats had some push back and that's it. The leg extender was stuck and won't extend. Cabin crew said they were helpless - they didn't even try to see if it can be worked. I had to spend the entire flight sitting upright cos without the leg extender to support, I was slipping down if I reclined the seat. Horrible experience and to top it all there event wasn't a TV on the 5 hour 20 minute flight. Cabin crew said that this aircraft only has so much facility and they were looking at each other and smiling when they heard that I actually upgraded to business class. I would like to know how I can claim a refund. Where and how can I escalate this matter to. I sent a dm on Twitter to the airline which they haven't responded. Such daylight robbery must not be permitted. This isn't the upgrade we pay for. I am going to share my horrible experience on all social media channels.

11,"One of the worst airlines I travelled on. KQ765 delayed out of JHB with no reason given only left at 02:30 on Sunday morning 25 June in stead of 01:15. Missed our connection flight out of Nairobi to Zanzibar. Ground staff made us wait for 3 hours before we got any assistance in Nairobi. Eventually got a Precision flight to Zanzibar after we had to fight the staff for seats. We were assured that the flight will have our baggage on it as it was scheduled to leave 3 hours after we got our seats. When we arrived in Zanzibar we had no baggage and the ground staff was rude saying it was not their fault we did not have our baggage and that it would be at the Zanzibar airport on Sunday evening with the next flight and if we want it we can come fetch it then. We where on honeymoon and our Hotel is 1 hour 20min away from the airport, as we booked a all inclusive package which included our transfer to and from the hotel, we had no means to get back to the airport to collect our bags. We requested that they please deliver the bags to the hotel. Ground staff said they can only deliver on Monday morning. When we asked for compensation to get some necessities like toothbrush and clean clothes, as we had no clothes or toiletries and had a dinner reservation for Sunday evening, we were told it is not their problem nor their fault our baggage did not arrive and they rushed us out of their office. Needless to say we did not receive our baggage that evening. Monday morning 26 June I phoned the lost baggage office and was told the delivery will only start work at around 10:00 and would need to make a few stops before he gets to us.

12,"No where near does this airline come to being called the pride of Africa, it has made us as Kenyans embarrassed. The flight itself delayed for over 4 hours with no valid explanation nor any compensations. No regrets no apologies. The cabin crew are probably the rudest you'll ever come across as if they are doing you a favor. No courtesy and concerns for the three infants and 1 elderly I was traveling with on the contrary we were begging for the very basics and still not provided, like infant food! Inspire of pre-arranged meals non of my infants got the baby meals. The aircraft they are using is not for long distance international flights as the seats are extremely compact and zero legroom. We came out of the flight tired and exhausted as if we had been in war. Ground crew at both the airports equally the same and no sense of responsibility. Check in experience, 1.5 hours just to check in my family of 5 adults and 3 babies. How in the world can you explain this? Cabin smells stale from previous flight and nothing fresh.

I watched a cookery show and learnt a recipe on flight. Also a construction show though took it off half way due to the swearing. There wasn't much to watch for me but I left happy learning a potato recipe from South Africa. A bit of a delay in Nairobi for an hour but as I was on holiday it didn't spoil any plans. I spoke to a lady going to USA and she was given accommodation for missing connecting flight. So not so bad. My issue seems mild but one that all schools are aware of in London. We had a nut snack and I did hope that those with nut allergies where considered. At my children's 3 schools, we simply remove nuts from children packed lunch or school dinners and from view as some people get very bad allergies.

16,"Not Verified |  I had booked a return flight from Copenhagen to Mombasa and back. Unfortunately I missed my connecting flight going to Mombasa. I booked another flight to Mombasa and I immediately contacted Kenya Airways customer support to find a solution for my return flight. I wrote and called them for a week before I heard back from Kenya Airways. Fortunately the reply was (in writing) that my return ticket was confirmed. When I went to Mombasa airport to fly back they could not find my ticket. I showed them the email with the confirmation and the Kenya Airways lady in Mombasa agreed that it said my ticket was confirmed. Head office refused to let me onboard unless I purchased a new ticket. I did so to come home to my family and I was advised to contact customer service when I got back to get my money back. Then followed several months where I have been writing with Kenya Airways Customer Support. All sort of excuses came up claiming I had the wrong visa, to me being a student and other lies. Finally they concluded that in reality I had not purchased a new ticket, instead I had paid a penalty fee for missing my original flight. I then provided Kenya Airways with a copy of my receipt from Mombasa airport that clearly states that I had to my a new ticket. Since then Kenya Airways have ignored my emails. I am really shocked how Kenya Airways has tried to avoid taking responsibility and done so by lying, bullying and inventing stories to make me drop my claim.

17,"I have been flying with Kenya Airways for the past 6 years, experienced a delay once which was okay but I had the worst experience in May where both trips were a disappointment. First, on the 14th May my Departure was delayed from 6am to 4pm. No apologies nothing, they kept on rescheduling the flight without proper communication. We late boarded Emirates to Nairobi. Again it took us hours to board from Nairobi to Mombasa. I was supposed to arrive at Mombasa 11am on the 14th Sunday but we arrived 2am on the 15th Monday.Worst scenario was on 28th May, my flight was scheduled at 8:45pm to Nairobi then connecting flight at 11.45pm.I arrived on time waited on the queue reaching the counter am told my flight was rescheduled to 7pm! On the screen I could see clearly my flight displayed at 8:45pm.Seriously ! Without even sending a notification, remember while booking phone number and email address is always part of the reservation details. The staff showed no remorse and asked me to check with reservation team. I walked politely to KQ office. I was so shocked when the reservation agent told me that my ticket is not valid ,that it's just a paper - so from changing the time to my ticket being void. This was the worst respond ever! Kenya airways staff lie a lot. He even told me that they tried to send a notification of which he wasn't sure.

18,"At a time when many airlines are improving their product, Kenya Airways appears to be going in the opposite direction. Getting onto the aircraft in Nairobi was chaotic with no priority given to business passengers – for the airline ‘Sky Priority’ means nothing. From the boarding gate we then went on a long bus journey around the airport before returning to part of the terminal to climb up stairs to get onto the aircraft. Although the cabin crew were very pleasant and offered a pre-flight drink (champagne, water or apple juice) no more drinks were served until after the meal arrived. This was a total disappointment with my beef option consisting of two small pieces of beef, some sauce and a mini samosa. It was complemented with a glass of wine in a thimble-sized glass which was only refilled when we asked the crew. One of the mysteries of the flight was why the lavatory at the front of the aircraft permanently had an engaged light on. When we asked we were told that the captain had said that it was ‘reserved for the crew and passengers could not use it’. Another mystery was a man who spent the entire flight sat on the crew jumpseat in the middle of the business section. I asked him what he was doing and he explained that the crew ‘could not find me anywhere to sit’. Given that airlines flying into the UK have a legal obligation to provide advance passenger information 24-hours before arrival it would be interesting to know how this requirement was met. Although the aircraft was clean and the flight was smooth, Kenya Airways’ 787 are let down by their old-style side-by-side seating which was worn and, in some cases, not functioning properly. The fact that the flight was full suggests that the airline has no problem selling tickets and therefore little incentive to improve its product.",2023-06-03,True,time many airline improving product kenya airway appears going opposite direction getting onto aircraft nairobi chaotic priority given business passenger airline sky priority mean nothing boarding gate went long bus journey around airport returning part terminal climb stair get onto aircraft although cabin crew pleasant offered pre flight drink champagne water apple juice drink served meal arrived total disappointment beef option consisting two small piece beef sauce mini samosa complemented glass wine thimble sized glass refilled asked crew one mystery flight lavatory front aircraft permanently engaged light asked told captain said reserved crew passenger could use another mystery man spent entire flight sat crew jumpseat middle business section asked explained crew could find anywhere sit given airline flying uk legal obligation provide advance passenger information hour arrival would interesting know requirement met although aircraft clean flight smooth kenya airway let old style side side seating worn case functioning properly fact flight full suggests airline problem selling ticket therefore little incentive improve product

Total loss considerably more than the original return flight total. Sent at least 8 messages to customer support. Initial replies reassuring and seemed to offer resolution, but nothing happened. Reassurances turned out to be misleading and the information I needed was never offered.

No useful information is provided. It also appears that agents do not have the authority to actually resolve anything.

22,"Kigali - Nairobi - Entebbe return 26-27 March 2023. Aircraft were narrowbodies. The first flight was on a B737, while the three remaining flights were on E190’s. All four (short-haul) flights were on time. This was a Mileage Run to retain my Flying Blue gold status as it otherwise was going to expire by end of the month. I was at first travel attempt denied boarding and my ticket was suspended by a junior staff in Kigali. They said, upon liaising with Immigration I Airport, that my reason to travel was not valid. I tried to change purpose, but the damage was done, which forced me to postpone the entire trip. However, later I had the ticket reissued by KQ town office in Kigali, who were professional and committed to help without any payments as it was not a No Show case. They even took over the booking from my travel agent which was effective and great relief avoiding potential additional costs. I even got a much better (and more expensive) itinerary avoiding night-flights though extending my transit lounge stays. While the junior KQ staff in airport should be sacked for denying me boarding, the KQ staff at town office should be praised and rewarded for constructive and expedite provision of resolutions and quick ticket reissue by ignoring and avoiding the OTA. The rescheduled trip went fine in all aspects. Lounge access accommodated prior to all 4 flights, and the lounges are all of good and solid quality. Slept fine in Pride Lounge in Nairobi where I spent an eve and a night. Effective boardings/deboardings by either bus, on foot, or by jetbridge. Onboard, welcome champagne available on all four flights. I had prebooked seat 1A which was given me throughout. I preordered my favorite seafood meals which were delivered and tasty. The sole exception was a morning flight, where they could not manage my seafood, despite it appeared in their flight manuscript; not a big issue, but they apologised. KQ always manage special meals effectively; this is really a perk that not even legacy carriers like Qatar Airways or KLM allows for. The crews on all flights were fine, professional, caring, and in good mood. The food is getting better on these regional flights, and I had my tasty hot mini-meals served throughout. Hot towels provided. Nut mix were provided as snacks provided to assist on drinks, which were served several times. The challenge of my trip was the seemingly unusual turn-around in EBB to which airport staff were confused as I instantly returned to my origin without going landside. They allowed me not to buy a transit visa, and escorted me to transfer security and thereafter negotiated excessive spending time in lounge for me – I was granted full access for 7 hours though the airline agreement was only 3 hours. Onboard, no IFE and no WiFi which is fine for short flights. No luggage/baggage issues. Flying Blue status respected and some SkyPriority entitlements were given. E.g. priority boarding. Recommended.

23,"This review is regarding Kenya Airways customer service and has nothing to do with the details of a specific flight. Our return to Chicago was cancelled when the KA pilots went on strike. My family of four was left to arrange alternate flight arrangements by ourselves and our travel agent who was back in Chicago. We absolutely received no help from anyone at KA. Finally got economy class tickets with Turkish Air which we took from Nairobi to Istanbul and home to Chicago. Had to pay for those tickets and was told to wait for a refund of the return with KA for our cancelled business class tickets. As it turned out, we had to wait a while for our refund which finally arrived on Feb 27. The refund was issued for almost $1200 each ($4800 for the four of us). While this may sound fair, please consider that we paid a total of $14,647 for our four business class round trip tickets to Nairobi and back. Additionally, we had to pay for our return via Turkish Air at a total of $6356. So the refund represented less than 1/3rd of the cost of the original round trip tickets. We were hoping for some consideration of the cost we incurred with Turkish Air, which ultimately was caused by KA. Following a recommendation from the CEO of KA I was contacted by one of his subordinates. While, I do believe that this individual may have had some impact upon the processing of the refund, I disagreed with him on numerous occasions when he and his staff tried to explain the refund policy to me following disruptions in service. The following is a direct quote from his email to regarding these situations: “In the event of disruptions such as the strike, the airline makes arrangements to carry you at the earliest opportunity on one of our scheduled services or reroute you to the destination shown on the ticket by our own services or those of another carrier at no additional cost to you. Should the alternative flights not be suitable or we are unable to rebook you to an alternate flight, you are entitled to a refund of the value of the unused portion of your tickets.” I contended to him that neither myself nor any member of my family was approached by anyone from KA to reroute us OR that anybody at the KA desk was willing to assist us make alternate flight arrangements. I was particularly incensed when I read the words in red, stating “…at no additional cost to you.” I feel lied to and disrespected by Kenya Airways in their addressing our significant and inconvenient disruption of service. I have found examples of other travelers on our flight similarly affected by the strike who had desk clerks reroute them with no additional out of pocket expenditure. The positive feelings I had about Kenya Airways prior to leaving Africa have been replaced by a lack of trust, a vow to never fly KA again, and to pursue informing all travelers I can to be aware and leery of KA’s management of refunds and its ultimate care and respect for passengers.",2023-03-28,True,review regarding kenya airway customer service nothing detail specific flight return chicago cancelled ka pilot went strike family four left arrange alternate flight arrangement travel agent back chicago absolutely received help anyone ka finally got economy class ticket turkish air took nairobi istanbul home chicago pay ticket told wait refund return ka cancelled business class ticket turned wait refund finally arrived feb refund issued almost four u may sound fair please consider paid total four business class round trip ticket nairobi back additionally pay return via turkish air total refund represented le rd cost original round trip ticket hoping consideration cost incurred turkish air ultimately caused ka following recommendation ceo ka contacted one subordinate believe individual may impact upon processing refund disagreed numerous occasion staff tried explain refund policy following disruption service following direct quote email regarding situation event disruption strike airline make arrangement carry earliest opportunity one scheduled service reroute destination shown ticket service another carrier additional cost alternative flight suitable unable rebook alternate flight entitled refund value unused portion ticket contended neither member family approached anyone ka reroute u anybody ka desk willing assist u make alternate flight arrangement particularly incensed read word red stating additional cost feel lied disrespected kenya airway addressing significant inconvenient disruption service found example traveler flight similarly affected strike desk clerk reroute additional pocket expenditure positive feeling kenya airway prior leaving africa replaced lack trust vow never fly ka pursue informing traveler aware leery ka management refund ultimate care respect passenger

The contents of these canisters was not revealed to me even though i asked. I am on day 7 of feeling very ill with breathing trouble and eyesight and diarrhoea. I attribute this to the 3 episodes of being sprayed - once on the first flight, then again while stationery at Victoria falls by crew with big spray containers and hand sprays as you would do in a field (or should not do). Then again after departure from Nairobi. The food was mediocre to poor. I’d hate to think what the economy class food was like if this was business class.

We eventually left and arrived too late for our connecting flight to Johannesburg. Kenia Airways wasn’t prepared at all for this eventuality even though they knew about it for more than 12 hours. We were bundled into a group, and they tried sorting out the passengers rerouted flight. This took Kenia Airways 4 hours to complete for us, some passengers were still waiting after us.

After being sent to 3 different counters we were directed to the Airlink Customer Service Centre. Here we met our angel who checked and assured us that the luggage never arrived in Dar Es Salaam which means that Airlink didn’t receive it from Kenia Airways. This meant it wasn’t Airlinks responsibility anymore, but they then told us that they will load an enquiry and get the process going. Upon loading, he realized that the luggage was still in Nairobi but was scheduled to be on Flight KQ760 on 7/1/2023.

58,"This is the worst airline I have ever flown. We booked roundtrip direct flights to Mauritius to and from Nairobi for our honeymoon. We planned to spend 7 days in Mauritius. The night before our flight from Nairobi to Mauritius, I was emailed (yes, emailed) at 11.19pm while I was sleeping to inform me that our flight time was to be changed from 1.00pm to 7.30am. As I was understandably sleeping at the time, I did not review this message until I woke up at 5.30am that morning. I was staying in Naivasha, Kenya at the time and so did not have time to make it to the airport. We immediately called due to the fact that we were going to miss our flight and no one was able to explain to us why this change was made so last minute to the flight schedule and why we were not informed ahead of time. I would think it would be common sense that an email in the middle of the night 8 hours prior to the new proposed flight time (for a now 7.30am flight) is insufficient notice. Even after speaking to multiple different Kenya Airways employees, I was never given a reason for the flight time change (just ""operations""). Ultimately we were rebooked for a flight late that day, but this was an indirect flight through Dubai, which didn't leave until 5.10pm and involved >16 hours of travel instead of what was supposed to be a 4 hour and 20 minute flight. Because of this, we were unable to check in for our hotel that we had paid for the night of our arrival and instead arrived the next morning, exhausted, having been traveling all night and transferring in Dubai in the middle of the night. To boot, the behaviour of the passengers on the plane from Nairobi to Dubai was absurd. People were constantly standing up on the plane and blocking the aisle even after being asked to sit down by flight attendants. Kids were running around unrestrained and flight attendants had to ask over the intercom for parents to restrain their children multiple times. In the row in front of me someone was watching a movie on a tablet with nonstop gunfire with the volume on max and he was not using headphones. To top it all off, in addition to missing our first night of the trip, Kenya Airways also changed our return flight time, moving it up from 7.10pm to 1.40pm. This effectively compromised two different days of our trip (as we were unable to do much the morning of our departure and were unable to take advantage of the late checkout that we were qualified for at our hotel). On top of it all, our return flight was ultimately delayed by 40 minutes and the process to check in our bags took an absurdly long time, longer than it has ever taken for any other flight I have been on. We had all of our documents and it still took us >10 minutes to complete the check in process and this was after standing in line for one hour waiting for the check in desk. Bottom line, if you can avoid it, do not fly on Kenya Airways. You will absolutely regret it.

60,"Flying from Lusaka to London via Nairobi last month with Kenya Airways was a shocking experience. Pre-departure tests are no longer needed upon arrival to England. However, my instinct told me to check if I needed a PCR to transit through Kenya. The COVID information on the Kenya Airways website is extremely misleading. When I filled in all the details about my trip, it said nothing about a PCR test; however, when I spoke to an agent on WhatsApp they said I need a PCR test as I am not vaccinated (screenshots attached). Having to rush around Lusaka the day before I flew to London, I eventually got a PCR test. I arrived at Lusaka Airport at 23:30 on Sunday and did not get my bags checked in until 01:10 on Monday (5 minutes before baggage drop off closes) due to the airline and staff's poor customs. I knew my bags were overweight and decided to pay the additional cost rather than repack. I was told that I cannot pay using card and can only pay in Kwacha or US Dollar. I had £100, which was roughly the additional cost and it took over 45 minutes for the staff to find out whether I could pay using British Pounds and inform me. The ATM I was advised to go to outside on the bottom floor of the airport was out of service and I had to run to the domestic airport (10 minutes from the international airport if you're in shape) to withdraw cash from the second nearest ATM. The total amount was 2066 Kwacha and when I presented 2100 Kwacha, I was told they did not have any change...

A couple of hours later, I received a text message saying that the flight was going to be delayed from 0745 to 1120 for the usual ‘operational reasons’. On arrival at the airport the next morning for the delayed departure, I was issued with a boarding pass that still showed my original seat number of 19A. As it turned out, the airline had changed the aircraft to an Embraer 190 (which I discovered when we were boarding), so while I had the same seat number from the original 737, it was not in an exit row on the E190. No apology, no information at check in. Boarding was chaotic as usual. They called for Business Class and Priority passengers to board first (I have Siver Elite status), only for everybody to end up on a bus that waited until it was full before proceeding to the airplane. So much for priority boarding. Even with the delayed departure time, the flight was delayed even further, departing at 1220. KQ is a disgrace.

62,"Monrovia to Kigali through Accra and Nairobi 19-20 May 2022. The 2 aircrafts were both B737-800s in very good condition. I had to change my departure dates and it took me only 10 minutes online - and was even free as it was a “Business Light” ticket. All flights were on time. Checked in online. Monrovia Airport is full of hustlers pretending to be from the airline but want tips and they are annoying, the airline should chase them away. Kenya Airways (KQ) uses a third party lounge in Monrovia which is small but good with courteous, proactive attendants. No champagne, but plenty of drinks and liquor. The local Club beer is good. Embarking easy, fast, not a single crosscheck from lounge to seat – what a pleasure. Onboard, welcome drinks were served. The seats were huge and well bolstered, reclining, new, and very comfortable. Could sleep. IFE or WiFi was only working on the last leg. No printed menus were given out, but the FAs asked each individual on food choices. My pre-ordered special sea food meals were all different, delicious, and served without reminders. Business Class was full after Accra, but I did neither feel cramped nor stuffy. FAs, all Kenyans, were good and caring – though maybe not world class. In NBO the Pride lounge did the job for me during the 12 hours’ layover. The last stretch to Kigali was with IFE onboard, champagne, and my beloved seafood hot meal, which KQ still offers (even in economy) in contrast to Qatar and Emirates who have stopped this service at is it not qualifying as “dietary reasons” to order.

64,"Flew Kigali to Monrovia over Nairobi and Accra on 8-9 May 2022. Flights on time. Checked in online worked well and got my BPs in airport swiftly. No luggage issues. Recognised as Skyteam elite. Kenya Airways staff came to me in lounge and, without request, carried my hand-luggage for me from lounge to the aircraft. No waiting time nor queues anywhere on the trip despite the flights were full or almost full. KQ delivers and have rarely let me down over the years. Pearl Lounge in Kigali delivers but suffers from deprived views of airport runways. First flight was on an Embraer 190 which is a lovely, roomy aircraft. Onboard, they allowed me to shift to an exit row as my original seat was mistakenly occupied by another person. The seat now offered was very nice - it would have cost me 50 USD if booked online. Drinks were generously provided. Appreciate Kenya Airways often have the Happy Hour concept where a request for a single drink most often triggers serving two. The wine in mini-bottles was acceptable, a South African “Stonedale”. I had requested seafood meal and I got it: it was a cold, tasty salmon sandwich. FAs were kind and effective. No IFE nor WiFi but on a 90 minutes flight its not an issue. Transit in Nairobi Airport smooth and quick. It took me only 15 Minutes to reach the KQ Pride Lounge. I love this lounge, roomy and curvy designs with lots of nice sections. Had a god nights’ sleep after acquainting myself with a Niederburg rose-wine which superseded an alternative, Italian sparkling wine The next flights from Nairobi to Monrovia via Accra were on their B737-800. Despite the flight was completely full (all seats taken in both classes!) the staff manage to care passengers well. No power outlet nor monitors, only WiFi and use of personal devices were possible. Special meal rendered to perfection. I also tried other dishes as I was offered. Drinks provided generously, again Happy Hour (order 1 get 2) occurred at least once.

76,"Wonderful service onboard this early morning flight to Lusaka. Really enjoyed spending time in the new Pride Lounge (which is in another league in terms of ambience compared to the Simba Lounge - although I imagine the former could get quite busy), and appreciated the hassle free check-in and immigration process (although the Covid test check outside in the booth is quite strange). The only negative was the chaotic boarding processes, with no Premier World priority and a free for all to get final verification checks completed. Once onboard, treated to fabulous service from the purser who just couldn't do enough - from offering both business class breakfast options due to a quiet Premier World cabin. The warm fresh croissants and coffee were highlights. I bid to upgrade the ticket which cost $210 but it was really worth the splurge to arrive well refreshed for a day at work.

Wonderful to see KQ finally reinstate a full meal service on this route - I spoke to the purser who confirmed so many customers were on connecting flights that the company opted to stop the pathetic small ""pie"" - although I'm told on the early morning flight it is still a cold croissant and tiny piece of fruit, however on this leg a very impressive three hot meal options wee offered - I was the last seat on the last row at the back and they still had all 3 options available - and the traditional East African beef pilau was absolutely delicious. Cabin crew wonderfully interactive - and as always - cannot give you enough drinks - two bottles of wine and two lagers each time. One disappointment was the refusal of Lusaka KQ agents to allow me to use my Flying Blue miles to upgrade at the airport despite being assured by KQ HQ that it is was totally possible. I was told I would only get a bar service as they don't cater for additional unknown business class passengers, but my return trip just didn't bear this out.

78,"I had an issue with my Covid test (did it too early so it would have expired by the time I got to Ghana). The whole situation was such a mess, I was certain that I would not be able to fly. Lydia advised me that there was a quick testing station outside (which obviously required me to pay an arm and a leg because these Covid test fees are a scam. I digress). She waited for me until the last minute to get my results so she could get my bag checked-in. When I was running between the testing station and the check-in counter, she decided that I could leave my bag there (I was literally the only remaining customer, so she was just being kind) and took my number so I could run downstairs to go check on my results and she could call me once it was absolutely necessary for them to close the counter. She did call me, and while I was running a few minutes late, she spoke to her superiors who agreed that the time was negligible and I could therefore run back upstairs with my results while she waited to quickly send my bag through. Lydia was probably the most helpful airport person I'd ever met. While some of her colleagues were annoyed with my situation and essentially had given up on me, she endeavoured to help me well beyond her call of duty. This is the kind of South Africa I know - one filled with ubuntu, while acting within the confines of professional conduct.

79,"I never thought I would experience the worst customer care from an airline which boast itself as “the Pride of Africa”. Trouble started during COVID-19 test verification at the check in desk. My family of six (2 adults and 4 kids) were supposed to travel to JFK via London on 24/8/21. Three of my kids had negative test results while the rest of us had turned positive earlier in the month but had been cleared by a health official to end the mandatory isolation on 13/8/21. As required by CDC, in order to travel to the US, a passenger needs to have either a negative test result or proof of recovery (positive test certificate and a discharge letter from a health official) if they were COVID positive within the last 90 days. We presented our fully compliant documents to the check in clerk, but instead of taking their time to confirm that indeed those were the documents that were required at our final destination, she automatically rejected them and said we all had to have negative test results, otherwise we would have to go back and wait until we all tested negative! They didn’t have any reference sheet or document to base their decision on, the only reference was to pretend that they had called an office “who deals with this sort of thing” to confirm. Then enter a “supervisor “ who didn’t even take time to understand what the problem was and said without a care in the world right to our faces “oh, we deal with this sort of thing every single day. We send people home “. They never realized the agony we were going through. Never at any point did they produced any document to support their decision, in fact at one point the “supervisor “ disappeared to go retrieve an internal document that supposedly has the latest updates but returned 10 minutes later empty handed. They absolutely had no clue about what they were saying and could not even take a moment to check the requirements for our country of destination and the CDC website. What a total customer care failure and a huge embarrassment to the company! To say we were deeply disappointed is an understatement. It is a fact once one has tested COVID positive, it is not advisable to retest until after at least 90 days because chances are high that they can still test positive even though they are not contagious. This fact doesn’t seem to make sense to KQ check in clerks, or at least the two I was dealing with. The whole experience caused a lot of emotional distress especially to my kids not to mention financial loss and delay to get back to work.

82,"Business passengers went on last because the economy passengers would have walked past two business rows. This was, obviously, for covid-19 reasons but given that every passenger had had a negative PCR test it seemed a little pointless. There was a noticeable degree of irritation among those who had been made to wait until last especially as it is branded ‘Sky Priority’. The seats seemed slightly worn and although the dimmable windows are a nice touch in the 787 they are not as effective as pull-down blinds. We were offered soft drinks before take-off but they produced a glass of champagne when I asked. Breakfast was served before the lights went out. For the main meal the choice was beef, chicken or vegetarian. The cabin crew were polite and efficient although with so much protective equipment it felt more like being in an operating theatre rather than a plane. The food seemed bland and uninspiring.

83,"This was not my first time flying business with Kenya Airways but it was definitely not the best. The Plaza lounge at LHR was not serving alcohol on the basis that the food was not ‘substantial’. Boarding was chaotic – although there was a business line everyone was using it. After eventually getting on the aircraft, and after a long wait, I was offered a small glass of champagne. Seating was old-style parallel pair, business was about half full and there were signs of ageing. It then took an inordinate amount of time for the meal to be served – choice was “meat or chicken”. It was probably the first time ever that the starter and main course were both rice. The flight was uneventful and although not fully flat-bed I did manage to sleep. No bottle of water was provided. Breakfast was a small dry croissant, yogurt and a small bowl of fruit. I know airlines are struggling but given how much I paid for the ticket to have a service which was not as good as premium economy on some other airlines was frustrating.

92,"We flew from JFK to NBO just before the pandemic was declared. This was the first leg of a journey to Seychelles (SEZ). We found the cabin crew on this flight to be excellent, attentive, and really friendly. It seemed that the cabin staff were up and down the aisles very frequently and had a smile on their faces, something that must be tough during these times. We told them how pleased we were at the end of the flight and they seemed genuinely surprised to get the positive feedback. We passed this on to the airline via their website but have received no response as yet. Check in at JFK was easy, but probably atypical due to the reduced number of flyers in early March this year. The same could be said for the boarding process. The plane itself was new, a lovely 787 with mood lighting and big windows. The legroom was reasonable (not cramped but not luxurious). Overall it was comfortable for such a long journey. The food on the outbound journey was really good, way better than we expected, and our son' child's meal was also better than typical kids meals. The biggest negative on our outbound journey was the entertainment system. There were very few recent movies and the choice was extremely limited. Take your tablet or phone and download some eBooks, movies or other entertainment to it. if you are expecting to use the system on the plane to keep you occupied for 14 hours you will be disappointed. If I was rating the airline based on this flight I would actually give this flight 4 or even 5 stars as it was enjoyable but external factors are influencing that rating. Our return journey from Seychelles was delayed overnight by 14 hours and we had to fight to get accommodation. Due to this delay, and the Kenyan government ban on entry for foreigners due to COVID-19, it also meant our mini KQ Safari booked through the airline had to be cancelled. This is all very understandable and we have no issue with any of that. We cancelled this over email with the safari division while in the Seychelles and assumed there would be no issue. However, despite meeting 3 of the criteria needed for refund I am now going through a VISA charge-back process to recover this fee. First they say to talk to travel agent (when we booked the safari directly through them on a different credit card number) and then they say its valid for a year and they do not refund services .. despite having a clear statement on their website that a refund can be done if you fit 1 of the 3 criteria - 1. contact the email provided within 24 hours of the safari to cancel (we did it 6 days before), 2. Have a flight cancellation or delay (we were cancelled and put on a flight 14 hours later), and 3. Being denied entry to the country (the government were denying foreign nationals even with a visa - which we had).

96,"Nairobi to Mauritius This was the final leg of the itinerary from Manchester to Mauritius (Manchester to Nairobi flown with Qatar Airways) - flights sold by Qatar Airways. This flight was a short 4 hour flight. Nairobi Airport itself if not the best for transit, though we spent the 7 hour layover in the Pride Business Class Lounge (having paid $40 for a day pass) which was satisfactory. Cabin Crew appeared a little unfriendly on arrival onto aircraft, though pleasant with requests and service. The aircraft itself appeared old and tired, and could benefit from modernisation. For a small flight, a light meal was provided, which in honesty was good (Asian Vegetarian). Sadly few flight announcements and no advice that the plane was descending into Mauritius and landing - it just landed! No inflight entertainment - screen did not work! Finally the timing of this flight is not good. Arrival at Mauritius at 0300 in the morning is strange and untimely.

97,"Travelled Kigali via Nairobi to Johannesburg and back within 2 days mid-March 2020. Aircraft  were E190 on short leg and Boeing 787-8 on long legs. All flights on time. No luggage issues. Checked in online. Had to wait 1 hour in airport as they only open check in 2 hours before departure. Upgraded 1st leg KGL-NBO by a modest, but successful online bid. Granted lounge access by courtesy in Nairobi as my Gold Card was just earned during the same trip (but of course not processed in their system). In Kigali they use Pearl lounge which is deteriorating since Rwandair opened a new lounge opposite. Kenya Airways Pride Lounge in Nairobi is wonderful. Food served onboard was substandard and particular breakfasts were a disgrace. However, drink supplies were fine. I like the “Happy Hours” approach they use on regional routes like to Dubai and JNB where you order a drink or wine and they often double up the order without asking. I have only received this double up service before on Gulf Air and the now deceased Jet Airways. That is generous, positive approach and make one feel very appreciated and cared for in economy class where benefits otherwise are sparse.

100,"Johannesburg to Kigali via Nairobi 5-6 Feb 2020; on Boeing 787-8 and  Embraer 190. Almost on time; first flight fell 25 Minutes late. I had made a low, but successful bid for 2nd leg to be upgraded as it also gave access to Kenya’s Lounge in Nairobi which is good and spacious. Ticket cheap, bought from an online travel company. Kenya Airways have reduced luggage allowance for regional flights, with Silver level in their Flying Blue FFP I eventually managed to get a 2nd, huge suitcase, added to be check-in (first one included in ticket). Check-in, transfers, and communication went fine. Onboard, great service, lots of drinks as there seem to be a Happy Hour going on at afternoon/evening flights. Whenever passengers ordered juice, beer or wine they were instantly handed double up without discussion. I love that attitude. It gives a feeling of luxury. I have experienced this before with KQ (on their Dubai route). Food was good, two options with the possibility to add up more as long stock lasted. FAs were fine. Call bells answered. Duty free sales onboard worked well. The Dreamliner is great but space provided in economy is humiliatingly small. I was lucky to have 3 seats to myself to survive lack of leg and breathing space. Pride lounge in Nairobi is a breeze and I slept well till next morning to catch last leg as being upgraded. Last leg morning flight NBO-KGL was uneventful.

101,"Bangkok to Johannesburg via Nairobi on 5th February 2020. Both flights on newer B787-8 aircrafts. Check-in and luggage handling went smoothly, but had to fight a bit with ground staff to get all my BPs issued on spot. Booking handling online works well. Their AF-KLM lounge offered in Bangkok is poor (like Thai Airways lounges) but their Pride lounge in Nairobi is good and spacious. Hardware on Kenya Airways is good and they are good on ground to tackle even complicated issues. The FAs are also good, plenty, observant. They are mainly Kenyans which does not help Chinese nor Thai passengers much. The very weak point of Kenya Airways is the food. Business class does not provide food any better than their Economy class and is plain, without vision, looking shabby. Competing airlines like Ethiopian, Turkish, South African, and Egypt serves much better and inspiring food in their economy class. Steel cutlery and table preparation nice. But that’s it. Dinner from BKK was a cold shabby dish with chopped salad and 3 ridiculous small pieces of sliced meatballs. Breakfast offered was inedible continental or fried rice. Very poor offerings. No meat, no cocktails, no cheeses, no ice cream, no smoothies, chocolates, no fruits (watermelon does not count). Extremely poor catering, a disgrace for the airline. Beverages are shamefully very sparse, only 2 juices (apple or orange) are offered. Wines are only passable. Beers are cheap, waterish industrial stuff: 2 brands, Tusker and Heineken – not providing any alternatives to each other. No souvenir, no pyjamas, no luxury feelings at all. No lobster, no seafood, no caviar, no mutton, goat, pork, no beef, no chicken (maybe inside the breakfast sausage). FA staff admitted that economy class had the same catering as business though of course presented simpler. 1st flight on time, 2nd departed 1 hour late. Miles given quickly to Flying Blue. I will go again when the price is right. Lower expectation to food to zero and eat well at home or in lounge.

102,"Not Verified |  Johannesburg to Bangkok via Nairobi. As a fairly regular flier, this was one of the most disappointing flights I’ve ever been on. The Boeing 787 is a great plane, but from check-in to baggage collection and everything in between I was underwhelmed. The aircraft interior is tatty and dirty with frayed seat covers and ripped seat-back pockets that your phone falls through the holes. The cabin service only started 45 minutes after take-off, no water or drinks and they first serve their very mediocre meals before you get a small plastic cup of water which we got 1 hour into the flight. Then the dirty trays only get cleared around an hour after meals are served so you can’t stow the tray table and sleep until they’ve cleared the cabin. On both the flight to Bangkok and the return sector I tried in vain to call a cabin attendant using the call button, but they literally walk past you with the blue light glaring and carry on doing whatever they’re busy with. I needed assistance on one occasion as the passenger next to me spilled their whole drink over me and I needed a towel to dry my leg and shoes, but after 20 minutes I eventually switched off the light and gave up and slept with a wet leg. On another occasion I needed the attendant to take my dirty food tray (nearly a full hour after the meal had been served) so that I could stow my fold down tray to get up to go to the bathroom but he refused to take it and said I must wait until they clear the whole cabin. I chose Kenya Airways because it was the quickest trip with shortest connection and I assumed there would be similar service to AF / KLM with them being shareholders, but if I ever fly to Bangkok again from Johannesburg I will certainly pay the extra money and take the longer layover in Dubai or Singapore and fly Emirates or Singapore Airlines, I will not fly Kenya Airways long-haul again unless it’s specifically to go to Nairobi or elsewhere in East Africa.",2020-01-08,False,verified johannesburg bangkok via nairobi fairly regular flier one disappointing flight ever boeing great plane check baggage collection everything underwhelmed aircraft interior tatty dirty frayed seat cover ripped seat back pocket phone fall hole cabin service started minute take water drink first serve mediocre meal get small plastic cup water got hour flight dirty tray get cleared around hour meal served stow tray table sleep cleared cabin flight bangkok return sector tried vain call cabin attendant using call button literally walk past blue light glaring carry whatever busy needed assistance one occasion passenger next spilled whole drink needed towel dry leg shoe minute eventually switched light gave slept wet leg another occasion needed attendant take dirty food tray nearly full hour meal served could stow fold tray get go bathroom refused take said must wait clear whole cabin chose kenya airway quickest trip shortest connection assumed would similar service af klm shareholder ever fly bangkok johannesburg certainly pay extra money take longer layover dubai singapore fly emirate singapore airline fly kenya airway long haul unless specifically go nairobi elsewhere east africa

The day we booked we noticed a flight was cancelled and we phoned them to make sure seeing as we didn't receive an e-ticket. The woman said it's no problem we will receive our ticket the moment the flight is sorted we just need our booking reference. On the 15th Dec we were suppose to fly at 2300. With check-in they couldn't find our ticket and was sent to ticket sales. Ticket sales confirmed that we had paid and that we have a booking but no tickets were issued. When Kenya was finally reached they said they never received our payment. 2.5 hours later we missed our flight. Next day we start phoning them at 7am. When they finally answered they started this thing where they will tell you to please hold but end the line. After the fourth call we got through and the woman said we can fly at 14:30. At 10am we were at the airport at ticket sales. Once again no e-ticket and no response. By 12:30 we get the news. We have to pay for new tickets at a larger price than our previous tickets and they will refund our original price .. the absolute audacity.

In which anyone who purchased a beverage walking in the airport and then went to their gate were told it had to be consumed right then or thrown out.

We were told twice that the difference was $US210 per person. We reluctantly agreed to pay but specified we would pay by credit card so we had a paper trail when we subsequently complained to KA. We were told that if we paid cash we could pay at the Kenya Airways desk. If we insisted on paying by card we would have to go back through Security, but another visa (as we had technically left Kenya) and pay at the KA desk on the concourse. When my partner eventually got to the Kenya Airways concourse desk the staff insisted that he needed to pay cash. When he refused they suggested they would void the reserved Business Class seats. He continued to insist on paying by card. At this point the price for the upgrade mysteriously dropped from $US210 to $US184 per person. Our conclusion was that the relevant Kenya Airways staff had intended to take the additional $US52 as a “commission “. By the way, my partner wasn’t required to buy another visa.

121,"I was to fly on Sept 7th 10.55 pm Kenya time from Nairobi to New York/JFK. I got to the airport and cleared 3 rounds of security checks. After reaching the boarding gate, it was announced that the flight is delayed and now will depart at 1 am.   Around 9.30, they made another announcement that the flight is further delayed and will depart at 2 am. We were offered some dinner and around midnight asked to proceed towards the boarding gate where there was another round of security clearance, there is no water available beyond this point unless it’s a sealed bottle bought at duty-free.   At around 2.45, when there was no sight of a plane and when we inquired with the ground staff, Kenya Airways personnel made an announcement that the flight is canceled and will now depart at 2 pm the next day.   We were given transit visa voucher, however, upon getting to the Immigration line, were told the voucher is void without KA personnel signature. By this time, all of us were frustrated due to lack of proper communication and guidance.   After we cleared the long queue at Immigration, we got to the KA desk for the hotel reservation. There was no clarity or communication around hotel assignment. We had to hand over our boarding passes at random to agents who’d then shout out the names of passengers. As the lines grew longer, their ability to manage crowds and cater to our needs diminished – they were not able to answer simple questions such as which hotel to go to, when our bus/shuttle would arrive or what the process would be thereafter.   We managed to get to our assigned hotel at around 4.30 am. The wifi in the room was not working so we could not communicate with family regarding our whereabouts. The bedspread was torn and the bathroom had roaches and other insects. With barely 3 hours of sleep, we woke up to get breakfast which was below average.   We left for the airport by airport shuttle where the KA agent only provided boarding pass for the flight to JFK. The agent asked me to go to the gate to collect boarding pass for the flight from JFK- PHX. After reaching the gate, I was asked to go to the KA desk so the agent can further help with flight changes. I had specifically requested to be booked onto an earlier flight which the agent at the main counter confirmed was the case. However, the agent at the KA desk near the gates could not help and said they could book me only on the 8 am flight to Phoenix the following day – after an 8+hour wait at JFK airport, she said my seat was confirmed for this flight. The agent also confirmed my bags would be checked all the way through to Phoenix and just that I had to collect my boarding pass at KA counter at JFK.   At the fourth security check, I asked another KA agent if my bags would be through checked to Phoenix – she said I would have to collect them at the port of entry which is NY/JFK.  The flight which was to depart at 2 pm was delayed by an hour and departed Nairobi at around 3 pm. The in-flight service was poor, the agents were rude. I asked the attendant for an additional blanket as I started feeling the chills but I never got any.   We landed at JFK around 10.30 pm. After clearing customs/immigration, transiting passengers were advised to meet the ground staff. There was no ground staff at JFK for us to meet.

On the outward leg from London to Nairobi there was also a reasonable evening meal but on the return leg the ""lunch"" was miniscule. There were no visible water runs and the cabin crews did little outside the ""meal"" service.

128,"Johannesburg to Paris return. Kenya Airways does the job but don't expect much more than flying from A to B. On the good side, flight hours are convenient from Johannesburg to Paris and route is short. Flights were all on time, with short connections. KQ is part of the AF-KLM Flying Blue programme and that's very convenient (I'm Silver and got 3x23 kilos). FAs were fine and as already experienced on KQ they tended to be very generous on alcohol. On the downside KQ offers very poor service. IFE is extremely poor, with a very limited choice of films, most being rather old films, and the selection did not change between late July and late August! Besides IFE did not always work fine (sound problem on one flight). Food was very limited and very bad, particularly on 8 hour flight to Paris: no real dinner but just a fat meat roll, breakfast very bad - but food better from CDG as on so many airlines. NBO airport is small and clean, it was not crowded but very dull and very limited service. Ground staff at OR Tambo wanted us to pay for our children's car seats (about $ 400!) because on the website it was written that car seats were free for ""infants"" and they said children (aged 4 and 9) are not ""infants"" - very absurd rule! Hopefully the agent at the ticketing office was shocked by the price and sorry for us and finally they dropped the surcharge (as always, be kind with ground staff and stay calm!). Yet we saw latter the same ground staff member telling very rudely to a passenger going to Malawi that he would have to pay for a not-so-big cabin bag he was carrying.

133,"Dubai to Kigali via Nairobi. On time. KQ cannot handle transit luggage in Dubai anymore. This happens frequently to me as I often travel on a different ticket onwards from DXB when transiting. One has to hire a ground handling company DNATA (?) and pay them 90 USD to retag two suitcases forward. Instead, I opted to pass twice not only immigration but also security and train commuting. Had to reclaim my bags and check them in again at landside. Otherwise, everything went perfect. I sleep well on the Boeing 787, prefer the middle seats on 2nd row. FAs pleasurable and I allowed them to change my seat. I bought the tickets a year in advance and could at that time not connect easily to Kigali from Nairobi. Earlier flights are now available, but I opted not to change and killed my 12 hours in Pride Lounge in Nairobi with pleasure and in great comfort. Last flight on Embraer, also faultless. But inflight service poor and food is a joke: a single, cold, unappetizing sandwich. I wonder what they can serve cheaper for economy class. Beers and wine available but hidden not displayed on wagons. Business class was full and people were cramped in 1 x 2 configuration. Headsets were for economy class and only given on request. Luggage delivered at belt as some of the very last ones, more than 35 Minutes after passing immigration. No point of Priority Tags. Delay caused by examination of all bags prior to releasing them!

134,"Nairobi to Johannesburg return. Both flights delayed. A 3-hour delay out of Nairobi with no prior communication from the airline despite the fact that they ask for both your phone number and email address when you check in online. I actually received a text advising me of the delay after we landed in Johannesburg a full 3 hours late. Apparently the delay was caused by a technical issue with the airplane scheduled to operate the flight but the chaos at Nairobi Airport and a glance at the departure board showed most Kenya Airways flights delayed on the day for anything up to 8 hours! I'm skeptical that a technical issue on one airplane could cause that many delays, given the size of the airline and the different aircraft types it operates. The flight itself was fine, despite several irate passengers taking their frustration out verbally on the cabin crew who kept up a cheerful demeanor as much as they could. Food on KQ is nothing special, a tiny main course and a bread roll and bit of cake. Entertainment options are fine but don't seem to be updated much. Return flight from Johannesburg two days later also delayed 1 hour due to the flight departing Nairobi late. This time apparently they had a medical emergency with a passenger just after pushing back from the gate in Nairobi which meant they had to go back and put the unfortunate person in an ambulance.

They huffed and puffed when you kindly requested something as simple as some water (flight was over 14 1/2 hours). Secondly, they refused to accommodate anyone for seat changes, even when the customer is paying the upcharge. Third, we requested to get skymiles added from this trip and they refuse to give us our credit due to our ""class"". They are a part of the SkyTeam.

This is probably the number one reason I will never fly with this airline ever again. I am so angry with this. Bathrooms were dirty and never cleaned or restocked. There was several times that I had to walk to the back of the plane to find a stewardess and ask them to put more toilet paper in the bathroom or if there was any way they could clean the urine off the floor in every single one of the bathrooms.

However, due to serious delays by Cathay Pacific entering Dubai (from Saigon and Hong Kong), I realised almost a day before that I would not be able to make my trip from DXB. I cancelled my online check-in’s to avoid No Show, but had to forfeit upgrade and tickets according to fare rules.

This, without reissuing tickets (which were non refundable), without charging me for No Show, without loosing my upgrade, just out of courtesy, empathy and a well explained case from my side.

142,"Addis Ababa to Kigali via Nairobi on 16-17th May 2019 on B737 and E90, respectively.

The Station Manager in ADD went the extra mile to get me onwards the same day and he invited me to the Ethiopian Gold Lounge, that Skyteam uses. Service onboard fair, but food is ridiculous and substandard. They serve only microscopic meals, e.g. a little-finger sized hot roll snack from ADD to NBO (5 hours trip). That’s stingy. In NBO I had to spent the night but fortunately KQ granted me lounge access due to all the trouble that I have had. The prestigious lounge has food, views, and nice architecture with curving designs and view of tarmac. It has 6 beds in silent area and I slept well till next morning. Flights less than ½ hours delayed. NBO-KGL on the Embraer was delayed due to passengers could not fit their overhead luggage into the narrow space and some 5-10 pax was deprived their luggage to have it inscribed on site and put down in luggage room until we reached KGL.

143,"Bangkok to Addis Ababa via Nairobi. Transited in BKK from Vietnam and boarded after midnight 15th May 2019. Aircraft were the old Boeing 787-8 and 737, respectively.

Smooth cooperation with KQ and the AF lounge in BKK allowed me to relax in the lounge 6 hours until Kenya Airways could issue all 4 Boarding Passes of my ongoing trip to Kigali via Addis. Buying 2 tickets with complicated routing (married segments) turned out to be much cheaper than go direct. But time spent increases; likewise the risk of lapses. All flights punctual. Food only passable, only 2 options offered and only cold dishes for dinner. No cheese, no ice-cream. Other airlines do better in Economy regarding food. Drinks also very narrow offering with 2 industrial, cheap beers. Same for wines: only 1-2 options. Champagne offered (on both flights) was fine: JM Gobillard & Fils.

145,"Nairobi to Dakar via Abidjan. I have no idea why the airline is called the Pride of Africa. Maybe because it compares to some other very bad airlines in the region. Ok, the plane seemed good and the seats had a PTV which is pretty good and a newly introduced feature. That's about it. At Jomo Kenyatta the check in was slow, even for those having done a check in online, we had to wait in a line, no one told us which line to wait in and of course no drop off line, unlike advertised in the web page ... and there is no point in using the self check in machines, as you still have to go on the line  inside the airport, which is not the fault of the airline it is really hot and crowded, but the airline did not help because their boarding was done all at the same time, no groups. Once in the tarmac, maybe because they wanted to use only one bus, they waited a long time until we were really crowded and people started complaining and saying they would not get in the bus, then they took us to the plane where we waited about 5 to 10 minutes on the tarmac again (luckily it was sunny). We board the plane and have to wait almost one hour because the pilots do not have a flight plan. I go to the toilet even before taking off and it is very dirty already. Food was really bad for an almost 10h flight. Seat covers were falling off some seats. Entertainment is good but there is a problem... every time you open a new film, or show or whatever, it shows you the same publicity again, (we are already flying Kenya airways, no need to see the publicity 20 times). The publicity lasts about 7 minutes and runs over the show, so once your movie or show begins, you've lost a few minutes of it . that is something that they must fix. In the stopover, we were advised that we had to wait in the plane about 30 minutes. We waited 2h without air conditioning, over 40 degrees, people complaining, doors closed and of course no APU on, nor auxiliary power, why?  Food from Abidjan to Dakar was really bad .. a cold hard muffin and a mince pie that tasted so bad and was so dry many did not eat it. Anyways for a 2h flight you can't expect much, but in total it is a 10h flight for many so it is rubbish. Both landings were quite hard and I am an airline fan and private pilot. The second one can be justified due to wind, but the first one, surprised about it. In general, very good plane, nice flight attendants, and good entertainment system.

The worn down Embraer E190 was clean and had personal inflight entertainment with a few movies and series. The service was basic, a small breakfast and drinks were handed out.

Even then arrived Nairobi 50 mins early due to the strong tail wind and it was very bumpy flight. Cabin crew was attentive enough. Meal was just adequate enough. Lunch was served 1+hour into the flight and breakfast was served before landing in Nairobi. In between, there is only snack. There should be a dinner service as it was a quite long flight. The seat lacks padding for 14+ hours non-stop flight. Seat pitch and seat width are decent. AVOD Entertainment was provided; however, the choice of movie was very limited and listed mostly old movies which mostly I have seen. Ended up watching some foreign language movies which I enjoyed them. KGL-NBO flight was late due to arrival flight from Nairobi. It was a Embraer 190 craft. Seat was very comfortable which I wish they put them on the transcontinental flight. We were bused into the NBO terminal upon arrival. Had to run and cut the security screening line to make it to the gate that bound to JFK. Flight waited to get all the connecting passengers and luggage loaded onboard. The flight left about 50 mins late. And arrived JFK on time. NBO-JFK flight has different AVOD entertainment menu as it was a month later from JFK-NBO flight. The movie lineup was updated with new movies. Flight crew was attentive. Water rounds came around every 1+ hour or so. Toilets were kept cleaned. All in all, everything went well.

156,"Harare to New York via Nairobi. I was super excited to travel to Zimbabwe and see Africa for the first time and got the perfect excuse when one of my closest friends from college planned her wedding in Harare. My outbound flight on American Airlines was cancelled due to weather, leading to me missing my connecting flight on Kenya Airways. While this was unpleasant, no one can control the weather, and AA helped re-book me on a later Kenya Airways flight into Harare, Zimbabwe, so I made it on time to the wedding. After a few weeks of seeing Victoria Falls and making friends with lions, I got back to check into my flight back to New York with Kenya Airways. The attendant there let me know that I had been marked as a “no-show” on my outbound flight, and now my return ticket was cancelled as a result. After arguing that I clearly was re-booked on a later outbound flight, Kenya Airways told me I could get on the flight if I paid a “penalty” of $1200. As I had already paid for a round trip ticket, I indignantly refused to pay for my flight a second time and wound up missing the morning flight. Two more flights back to the States came and went, and I missed all of those flights as Kenya Airways demanded payments to let me onto a plane. I racked up hours of international cell phone call payments with American Airlines customer service and my travel agent, who all let me know that Kenya Airways was not picking up the phone, and they were the only ones who could get me on one of their planes. 16 hours later, having missed every flight that day, I finally gave in and paid the $1200 penalty, in addition to the $1600 round trip ticket I had already paid, and Kenya Airways let me on the flight back home. For the privilege of nearly doubling the cost of my plane ticket, I also had a 17 hour layover in Nairobi, after which Kenya Airways told me my flight to JFK was overbooked. Fortunately Kenya Airways did one thing right and found a seat for me onto the flight back to the States, which I had paid for twice.

157,"Johannesburg to Bangkok via Nairobi. The feeling I got flying Kenya Airways for the first and last time is that it’s missing a certain culture which is so important for customer loyalty. Our trip  was the worst I’ve ever taken with any airline. And I’ve flown a lot. Everything was matter of fact. Except for the last leg from Nairobi to Cape Town through Victoria Falls (which was still the wrong return flight and 24 hours too late) all flights were delayed between two and twelve hours. The on-board meals are half the size of comparably-priced flights and mostly junk. Drinks cart selection looks like Aeroflot in the 80’s. Kenyans are warm and inviting. Is there a reason why that cannot be the same at Kenyatta airport? Is Kenya Airways not the major airline of that airport? When there’s no culture at the top, there’s no culture on the ground. Rude immigration officers, and security personnel throwing bins at passengers. The “hotel desk” which had no signs was another terrible experience. Apathetic employees did the minimum required of them. Passengers already furious to have been delayed prior, and now having missed their connections, would have to wait till morning to catch the next (wrong) flight. And when you get your hotel sorted, you’re told the bus will leave “very soon” but the truth is they wait until enough people cram the bus and only then transfer the passengers to the hotel. And everything is done at snail pace, with total disregard and matter of fact. There are many wonderful and accommodating employees along the way, but that is not the point. We all tend to remember the negative and unpleasant, but the right kind of culture has no room for negative. Customers have choice, and if enough customers stop using Kenya Airways, will that make its point?

When the delay announcement is finally made KQ offers passengers no respite not even a snack voucher for a delay of more than 4 hours.

165,"Accra to Dar Es Salaam via Nairobi. We were supposed to be picked up from the airport in Dar Es Salaam by our tour guides and taken straight on a 3-day safari. We booked and paid for our flights with Kenya Airways 2 months ago believing Kenya Airways to be a reliable airline. When we arrived 2 hours prior to our flight to check in, we were told that the flight was full. Despite the fact that we had arrived within the requested time to check in and had paid 2 months prior to the flight, we were kicked off the flight. There were multiple other passengers that also were not able to check in because of too many ticket sales - 1 of them had been able to buy a ticket that same morning online despite there obviously not being any left! We purchased our tickets 2 months ago - how were there still tickets on sale the same morning and yet we, who purchased our tickets 2 whole months ago were kicked off the flight?! This is unacceptable!! Another had arrived 2.5 hour prior to departure and had still been kicked off. He had also purchased his tickets much later than we had! We were out in a hotel for the night with boarding passes printed for the next flight in 24 hours but also with the promise by Kenya Airways staff that early the next day they would try to find an alternative flight to get us to Dar Es Salaam earlier. We were already going to miss our airport pickup, who was taking us straight onto a 3-day safari for which I had already paid $300 US for. We were interrupted during breakfast to rush back to the airport. The staff told us we had been booked onto an Ethiopian Airways flight through Addis Ababa but they did not have flight details to supply us with. They cancelled our tickets for the Kenya Airways flight that night. After a long wait in line, the check-in staff found only 1 ticket, rather than 2. They couldn’t tell us arrival time in Dar Es Salaam but checked in our bags and a long time later gave us boarding passes. On checking them, we discovered our route would now include a 26-hour stopover in Addis. Not only were we leaving a day later than our initial flight, but we would be now be arriving 48 hours later - a whole 24 hours later than if we had gone with the later Kenya Airways flight. On showing the staff at Kenya airways what they had swapped us over to, they then told us the Kenya Airways flight that night was already full and we couldn't fly. Seriously, this was ridiculous. We were made to go back to the hotel and brought back to the airport that evening without any communication as to whether we would even be flying. There was no offer of any compensation for the mess made by Kenya airways - no upgrade, not even an airport lounge, no offer of a partial refund, not even an apology. Instead, we had a completely wasted day with massive amounts of stuffing around by Kenya Airways. None of it was due to anything that we did wrong.

166,"On July 2, my wife and I were scheduled to fly Nairobi to London on Kenya Airways, then on to the United States on Delta. I am a US citizen and my wife is a Kenyan citizen with a US permanent resident card (aka ""green card""). All went smoothly until the agent checking paperwork at the gate immediately prior to boarding denied boarding to my wife based on the idea a transit visa was required in the UK, when in fact no transit visa is needed for our situation. To make matters worse, when my wife returned to the ticket counter for further assistance (as instructed by the gate agent), she was told there was nothing they could do for her and that she would need to purchase an entirely new ticket. She purchased a one way ticket on another airline for a sizable sum. Of course I immediately filed a complaint with Kenya Airways and insisted on reimbursement. After numerous inquiries into the status of my complaint, and being told an investigation was ongoing, I finally received an email on October 4 in which Kenya Airways admitted the situation was entirely their fault. They offered what amounted to only 20% of the cost of her ticket for compensation. After several more emails back and forth, I've concluded they will never make things right and accepted their offer. It's impossible to argue with an airline headquartered in a developing country with no real consequences for appalling customer service.

I then had to connect the dots for the Kenya Air staff (as obviously they are not trained to use common sense or think of their customers at all).

At that point the stars aligned and she asked if I would prefer that flight, well yes, I would prefer getting to my lodge 3 hours earlier as it would be the middle of night! It gets better. I needed to return a day earlier so my agent called Kenya Airways on the cost to change - the cost they quoted was more expensive than just going on Expedia and buying new tickets from Arusha to Johannesburg on Kenya Airways.

180,"Entebbe to London via Nairobi. I recently spent some time volunteering in Uganda and whilst I was there broke and dislocated my ankle quite badly. I needed to return home a few days earlier than planned, to undergo surgery, so rebooked a flight at additional cost and requested wheelchair assistance. Upon arrival at entebbe airport, they seemed unaware of my situation despite having been informed, but did sort out some help. I also asked if it would be possible to be upgraded if there were spare seats in business class as it was important to keep my leg, which was in a cast, elevated as much as possible and particularly during a flight when it may swell more. The check in desk confirmed there were seats but that they couldn’t upgrade me there but that it should be possible in Nairobi where I would change to take an 8.5hr flight to London. At the gate in Nairobi I once again asked if it would be possible to sit in business class so I could elevate my leg. The man on the desk said that he couldn’t do anything without invoicing me but it was his attitude rather than refusal that really annoyed me. He was completely unsympathetic, laughing at me and treating me as if I was just trying to get some free perks. I was clearly in pain and the most annoying thing was that the flight was actually half full. As a goodwill gesture he’d ‘upgraded’ me to the seats with more legroom but as I explained to him when he did so, that would not help as there was nothing to rest my leg on, so it was still dangling down, putting pressure on the ankle and causing swelling. This seat was also very awkward to get in and out of due to the way the screens came out of the seat from the side and had no additional room to the side as the armrests were fixed. However, it did provide me with a great view of the business class section which was virtually empty, and I was galled to see there were several passengers in economy with at least 4 seats to themselves, enabling them to lie down for the entire flight and had they so wished to elevate their leg! At no point had the man on the desk mentioned that there were many spare seats which would have enabled me to elevate my leg quite comfortably, despite me explaining the issue. None of the air hostesses expressed any concern for my situation throughout the flight despite my obvious discomfort and attempts to create a platform from bags and cushions to rest my leg on. Whilst I understand that other people have paid for the benefit of a business class seat, I felt that in extenuating circumstances such as this, the airline could have made a goodwill gesture to ensure their passenger’s wellbeing and comfort. I will not be recommending them to others and certainly won’t be rushing back to travel with ‘the pride of Africa’ any time soon.

Inflight catering in 'Premier World' was mediocre. No menu was handed to passengers. A cold chicken pie and some 'vegetarian' snack was offered alongside a small chocolate cake after take-off for this 8h30 overnight flight. No appetizer, no salad, no option of a warm meal, just some basic finger food. The crew had to be reminded to hand out the amenity kits which contain eyeshades, socks ear plugs, a pen and toothbrush. Cabin lights were dimmed but the crew didn't bother to close the curtains between the galley at the second door and the cabin, leaving the front section bright and uncomfortable. Landing in Nairobi was 1 hr 20 minutes behind schedule, ground staff made little effort to accommodate connecting passengers who missed their connection. Overall an underwhelming experience.

187,"Entebbe to Mumbai via Nairobi connecting on Jet Airways to Colombo. The ground staff was acting completely arbitrarily, and each of them had different rules. Our main problem with Kenya Airways was not on board, but with the ground staff. My husband (Ugandan) and I (German) were booked on a flight to Colombo in Sri Lanka. It was a one-way ticket. Since the Sri Lankan Visa is only for 30 days, I had another flight booked with Malaysian Airlines to Cambodia within that period. My husband and I both had E-Visas for Sri Lanka. So when we came to Entebbe Airport, the Kenya Airways Lady at the Check-In counter didn't let us board the airplane. She claimed, that Ugandan citizens weren't allowed to go to Sri Lanka on an E-Visa (Our E-Visa was already granted and even certified by the Sri Lankan Embassy in Kampala). Also, she said that we had to have a flight from Sri Lanka back to our home countries and she couldn't let us go there on a one-way ticket. When I told her about our outbound flight with Malaysian, she said that there is ""a rule, that every person has to return to their home countries within one year"", so we had to show her a ticket back to our home countries, otherwhise she wouldn't check us in. As I said, she was acting totally arbitrarily. Unbelievable. So in the end I had to book a flight for each of us back to our home countries (which I of cause cancelled immediatly once arrived in Colombo). I did it right there and then at the airport, but she still had the opinion that our E-Visas weren't ok, so we missed the flight. Then, the lady took us to the Kenya Airways office at the airport and looked for another flight for us. But since ""it was our mistake"" that we missed it, we had to pay for the change fees. She then told us to go to the Sri Lankan High Comission in Kampala the next morning and apply for the normal visa. In general this lady was very rude, when I tried to explain to her that our E-Visas were already approved etc, she told me to shut up and that she was tired of dealing with people like us. So when we went to the embassy, we talked to the ambassador personally and he was completely shocked that they wouldn't let us board the airplane, since Ugandan citizens can go to Sri Lanka on an E-Visa and ours was already approved. He gave us his personal number, so that we could call im in case we would have any problems again. The next day the Check-In lady wasn't there and we had no problems to board the airplane, even though our visa was still the same and no one asked us for return tickets to our home countries. When I sent a customer complaint to the Kenya Airways Customer Service, they answered me that they received it and would forward it to someone from the Customer Service team. But after that, I didn't receive a reply for 1 month. So just recently I e-mailed them again, saying that I am still waiting for a reply, but nothing happend. I am deeply disappointed. This was my first experience with Kenya Airways, and it was the worst thing that ever happened to me in terms of flying. Never ever did I experience something like that with any other airline. I lost a lot of money and I didn't even receive an apologetic message from them, not even talking about compensation for the inconvenience. I would never recommend this airline to anyone!

While not at the standards of the Game Lodges and many restaurants in the country in terms of wait service, they were fine.

The point of taking this route was to get to Johannesburg before noon on Saturday 9th in order to attend to other commitments there. Kenya Airways seemed the most convenient for our requirements, there was a two hour plus gap between the scheduled arrival time of KQ513 and the departure time of KQ760 - so none of us could have imagined the nightmare that awaited us at the Kenya Airways hub in Nairobi!  Due to a 2hour 15 minute (or longer) delay of the departure of KQ513 from Dakar, we barely made it on time for our connecting flight. There was no ground staff available to assist us get to the connecting flight. The ground staff at the gate were quick to gleefully tell us that we had been off-loaded from flight KQ760 to Johannesburg.  They were there to block not to facilitate passengers. Following desperate pleas, they decided to board the business class passengers and not economy class - thus separating my colleague and I. When I pleaded on my colleague's behalf I was told that not enough meals were loaded into the economy class cabin!

201,"✅ Verified Review |  Dar es Salaam to Bangkok via Nairobi. It is obvious why this airline is in deep financial trouble. None of the payment methods on their website work - we tried several different credit cards from different banks from accounts in different countries (including East Africa) and none of them worked. Flights need to be paid for (with an additional fee - they will not waive it even though their website has payment issues) over the phone or through third-party websites. We needed to change our business class tickets to the next day due to unforseeable changes. Although their website says you can do this online, you can't. Again, it wouldn't take any payment method even when we did a 3 way call between our banks and the airline. Their solution was to write an email to their tech department. All of the flight options the website showed were different from what the Kenya Airways representative could see on their end. All of the flight options the representative could see were hundreds of dollars more than what was being shown to us on their website. After several hours (12pm until 7pm) and dropped calls later, they finally booked us a ticket that ended up costing us significantly more and we ended up losing our business class seats. We couldn't pay over the phone and so we were told we could pay at the airport at no extra charge. Upon reaching the airport, the ticketing agent charged us even more than the price on the emailed ticked we had. She refused to call the manager and told us we could either pay the extra money or not get on the flight. Once finally reaching our destination, we tried reaching out to Kenya Airways several times to share our poor experience, hoping they would do something about it to avoid losing our business in the future as we fly into East Africa often to vist family & friends. Instead, we were met with a generic email replies telling us they were ""looking into the situation."" This airline and their customer service is a disappointment.

212,"✅ Verified Review |  Hanoi to Johannesburg via Nairobi. We had the misfortune of experiencing 'the pride of Africa' on our honeymoon to Vietnam in April 2017. Our negative and unpleasant experience with Kenya Airways culminated in the loss of my wife's luggage upon arrival in Johannesburg. After numerous phone calls and emails, absolutely nothing was done to locate this luggage and eventually the airline merely admitted that it was untraceable. None of our calls were ever returned, we received differing stories of the bag not being loaded first in Hanoi and then in Nairobi. It became quite obvious from the outset that the airline did not care about this problem and could not be bothered to help us. The flight experience was unprofessional, tardy, and disrespectful towards the passengers. Traveling between Hanoi and Nairobi felt like the passengers were alone on the flight and when the air hostess staff were visible, they were sullen, impatient and obviously cared very little for the wellbeing and comfort of the passengers on board. Upon boarding the flight in Hanoi, we were not greeted by a single staff member. Passengers were sleeping in incorrect seats and no air hostess could be found to assist us. Food was served with an air of contempt and annoyance. The hot breakfast consisted of a stale croissant and fruit. Drinks were served once on the flight. Trays took more than an hour to be cleared. An all round ghastly experience hopefully not to ever be repeated. We arrived home from an amazing honeymoon with a bitter taste in our mouths and one less bag.

The service was personal, friendly and warm. Not too much or too fawning. The Kenyan coffee was a lovely surprise! My one complaint is that the in flight entertainment isn't up to the level of Emirates but I have encountered few airlines that have matched that.

216,"✅ Verified Review |  Despite a 2.5hour delay due to technical issues, the flight went on fine. A wide variety of food options were available, and the food was average. Seats were comfortable with excellent recline, and large (comfy) blankets are provided for sleeping. The bathroom at the front of the aircraft is quite small and cramped, offering no additional features compared to the bathrooms in Economy; in fact, the bathrooms in Economy are more spacious. Cabin lights are practically turned off overnight, allowing for a good night's sleep. There is a TV screen, tray table and power socket in the armrest. TV screen is nice and large. Noise cancelling headphones are provided, I found them rather comfortable and I have a fairly large head and wear glasses. The selection of inflight TV programs is average. Passengers in Business class are treated fairly well. An amenity kit is given (which contains a toothbrush, socks, a pen, a comb, and an eye mask) which is nice. Hot towels are provided at certain points during the flight including upon boarding. The lounge at Nairobi is also quite good.

217,"✅ Verified Review |  My Kenya Airways flight from Nairobi to Paris (a codeshare with Air France) was delayed and eventually left 14 h after the scheduled time. We had to queue for almost an hour at 1.30 am to get a voucher for a taxi as they were all written by hand and we were not given a hotel voucher, just told to go to a hotel (which very kindly took us in based on our word that our flight was delayed). We did not collect our luggage. We were told by KQ staff at the airport that we would be collected at 11 am the following day. The next morning I looked at my booking on the internet to see that the plane was scheduled to leave at 11 am. I took a taxi to the airport from the city and when I checked in I was told that the plane was leaving at 11 am. I got the same message at the boarding gate where they were getting ready to accept passengers. The airport staff seemed not to be aware that there were 200+ passengers in hotels in Nairobi. We had to wait for them to arrive. We were then told to go to gate 13 but the plane was at gate 14. We left 14 hours late. Kenya Airways staff made no public announcements during the whole of this shambles, and no apology was given until we heard from the pilot that passengers had to be collected from Nairobi. The staff at the gate seemed leaderless and unable to communicate with the many anxious passengers who had missed their connecting flights and would not arrive in Paris until 9 pm, too late to get anywhere.

The 787 is certainly an improvement in comfort and reduce negative effects of flying, but the Business Class of Kenya Airways is just no match for the price, which is 40% more than competition. All in the service is just behind. Lie flat seat is ok but already look old after couple of years, and the conception is already ancient (manual handset with a wire). Service is just too basic for the price you pay, and the staff is pretty cold, un-attentive and seem bored every time you ask something (not all of them, there are couple of pursers really doing it right, but the rest is awful). I am not asking much as flying is a commodity but a minimum of politeness when coughing up 5,000 USD for a 7h flight is a fare expectations, as the level of service is nowhere representative of that. Premium Economy in some European carriers is actually better service for 1/3 of the fare. Meal service is quite basic, you get the plates and in 5 min they are taken out. The cabin is ok but already looks old.

I was taking a school group to Africa and originally was trying to fly Ethiopian or Qatar, but both were booked out so we went with Kenya Airways. We were met at Suvarnabhumi Airport by an agent of the airline as we were a group and check-in was very smooth. Their Boeing 787 seems to have more pitch than others I have flown and so was much more comfortable for me with longer legs on an overnight flight. Flight crew to Nairobi were all African (I specify this as the Nairobi to Bangkok return flight they were all Asian as the flight continues to Hong Kong) and were very professional and provided good service. As the flight originated in China, most passengers on board when we boarded were Chinese and so were typically noisy during the flight, but no more than I have gotten used to!

221,"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Nairobi. The inbound aircraft from Nairobi was late into Heathrow, we had to briefly go back to the gate with a maintenance issue. One of my reading lights didn't work but these things happen with airlines. The crew was great, the cabin was spotless and meal delicious. They held the connecting flight to Mombasa for me, something that airlines promise but rarely do. That flight had a newish aircraft, charming crew and clear flight deck announcements. They served a warm breakfast, not bad for a 45 minute flight. KQ were equally good on a flight to London a couple of years ago after I slipped a disc and had to be taken home in a wheelchair. I was looked after perfectly until I reached Heathrow. My only criticism is the fault of Kenya Airports Authority. It is unbelievable in the 21st century that to get to JKIA's domestic terminal, you have to push your heavy luggage cart across an enormous car park with kerbs, busy traffic and dubious individuals who want to relieve you of your luggage temporarily - or perhaps permanently. There is no reason not to have a level, paved, lit, signposted pathway - after all if Kenya can get Chinese contractors to finish a brand new railway line between Mombasa and Nairobi with gleaming new stations and viaducts six months early, they can't prevail on the Chinese to build a simple path in a week - if the work is too onerous to do themselves, that is. Or would that deprive freelance porters of income?

222,"✅ Verified Review |  Nairobi to Mt Kilimanjaro. We arrived in Nairobi with some lateness from our BA flight and had to transfer to our Kenya Airways flight to Mt Kilimanjaro. Since our luggage was not checked through we were told we should proceed to immigration collect our luggage then check into our Kenya Airways flight. The minute we arrived with lateness we asked some official in the airport where to go. They pointed us towards the connections area up some stairway. We proceeded to the Kenya Airways desk, the staff were a bit clueless as to what to do until we were told to go to another desk, who in turn told us to talk to BA. After bouncing around a few desks (running) we knew we were not going to make our flight and our luggage would be left in the collection belt. We decided to miss the flight and try for a later one. The Kenya Airways staff were absolutely unhelpful. When trying to purchase the tickets we were sent to another desk, guess what, they don't take cards. And the tickets were 320$ each. At this desk we were finally told the only way to sort this was to go through immigration, collect our luggage, go to the other terminal to another Kenya Airways desk, buy our tickets then check in. In my lifetime of travelling, this was one of the most gruelling and awful experiences I have ever had. After collecting our luggage and walking outside being accosted by random ""officials"" trying to make a quick buck and people trying to scam us we made our way to the Kenya Airways office. They then offered us a pair of tickets which were now $420 each, apparently our no show on the flight we missed incurred a fee. They were taking advantage of the situation despite none of this being our fault, and only due to their incompetence. We had no choice but to buy the tickets and move on.

226,"✅ Verified Review |  Johannesburg to Bangkok via Nairobi. Terrible airline - do not book Kenya Airways! We originally booked our Johannesburg to Bangkok tickets via Nairobi because of the short travelling time - there was only a 1-1.5 hour layover in Nairobi each way. Months after booking the ticket, Kenya Airways rescheduled our flights so that there was a 7 hour layover in Nairobi. The 7 hour layover ended up 5 hours longer than expected because the flight to Bangkok was severely delayed (this after our flight to Nairobi had been delayed by 2 hours and used a different aircraft that did not have in flight entertainment). The 5 hour delay severely impacted our plans in Thailand, creating great inconvenience and forcing us to make additional travel arrangement to the island we were staying on, at our own expense. When we raised these concerns with the Kenya Airways service desk at Nairobi airport, we were told that they could not assist us and we had to log a complaint with Kenya Airways customer service. My partner logged a complaint - we have still had no reply to this. We faced the same experience on our return flights - the flight from Bangkok to Nairobi was delayed by 3 hours which meant we missed our connecting flight to Johannesburg and were put on the next flight out - another 7 hour wait at Nairobi airport. Then we were notified that we had been moved to a later flight that evening because a smaller aircraft had to be used. When we eventually arrived back in Johannesburg, my partner's bag had been left in Nairobi. The agent at the Kenya Airways luggage desk told us it would be couriered to us the next morning - it was only delivered at 10pm the next night. Our flights with Kenya Airways ended up being the worst travel experience of any airline - we ended up spending over 20 hours extra at Nairobi airport as well as 5 hours extra at Johannesburg and Bangkok airports due to KQ delays - an entire day of our holiday lost due to their inefficiencies.

Instead they said that there was no evidence that I brought the item onboard therefore they could not do anything to help, no form that I could fill in for lost items, no documentation for an insurance claim, just a short, rude reply from their customer services which made me think that this was not the first time that this had happened and that I should make other potential Kenya Airways customers aware of this - if you leave something of value on the plane in Nairobi, don't expect to get it back.",2017-01-17,False,review london heathrow cape town via nairobi flight expected pretty basic economy class hour overnight wait connection nairobi return leg awful cheap would never fly kenya airway due terrible customer service fiance left item display seat pocket front realised soon left plane staff board contacted within minute u getting terminal item mysteriously disappeared cleaning followed customer service phone said would investigate never called back email know fault leaving item would expected least helpful dealing enquiry show sympathy kind apology instead said evidence brought item onboard therefore could anything help form could fill lost item documentation insurance claim short rude reply customer service made think first time happened make potential kenya airway customer aware leave something value plane nairobi expect get back

Cabin crew consistently excellent, and beverage services generous. KQ offers 2 x 23kg bags to Madagascar (unlike all their competitors flying the route) but the KQ agents admitted the smaller planes that use the route (E190) cannot cope with the loads when the flight is full (which ours were) which resulted in ours and many others bags not making it from NBO - although it followed the following day. We were disappointed that they were not able to deliver to our hotel we had to return back to the airport and wait for hours for the bags to be released.

236,"✅ Verified Review |  Djibouti to Zanzibar via Niarobi. Some friends and I decided to take a short trip to Zanzibar over an extended weekend for about four days. Unfortunately, more than 1/3 of our trip ended up being spent in transit. I am thoroughly disappointed by the lack of professionalism and competence repeatedly displayed by the Kenya Airway agents in the Nairobi airport. The first flight to Nairobi was more than an hour late. When we arrived in Nairobi we immediately went to the Kenyan Airways counter, knowing we had missed our connection. The attendant at the counter told us there were not any other flights that would get us into Zanzibar that day and the only one available left close to midnight and we would arrive the next morning. This was a lie. We waited a bit and went to another desk and the person there found a flight leaving that evening and though we still spent more than 12 hours in the airport, it would get us into Zanzibar about 11 p.m. When leaving the airport from Zanzibar on the return flight Sept 4 the personnel at the counter (Precision Air) would not print both our boarding passes, they told us we had to get them at the desk in Nairobi. We had a 1 hr and 15 min layover and immediately went to the desk to get our tickets. Of course the queue was very long and half the customers ignored it and walked right up to the desk - which the Kenya Airline employees did not seem to care about. When the first of our group arrived at the desk we still had just over 30 minutes before our flight left. We had already spent 30 minutes in line because of the horrible time management and inefficiency of the staff. When we arrived at the desk the gentleman told us we missed our flight. Again, we still had 30 minutes to get to the flight and should have already been checked in when we checked in at the Zanzibar airport. They then told us even if we were first in line at the desk when the plane landed (an hour before takeoff) we still would not have been able to board the plane. Why not? Why would they sell us a ticket on Kenya Airways own website that was a fraud? The entire time we are talking with the desk people they are again, randomly talking to other customers who just walked up (like the outraged lady who was supposed to being going to one location but the Kenya Airways attendants booked her to the wrong country - I didn't really blame her), checking their phones, and essentially being some of the most atrocious customer service representatives imaginable. They were flippant and did not care. To make the long story shorter, we were stuck in the airport until after midnight before we were moved to a hotel then returned the next morning for an afternoon flight - which was of course delayed a couple times. The flight attendants were wonderful though none of the entertainment systems worked on the flight. I would not recommend this airline unless you literally had no other options.",2016-09-22,False,review djibouti zanzibar via niarobi friend decided take short trip zanzibar extended weekend four day unfortunately trip ended spent transit thoroughly disappointed lack professionalism competence repeatedly displayed kenya airway agent nairobi airport first flight nairobi hour late arrived nairobi immediately went kenyan airway counter knowing missed connection attendant counter told u flight would get u zanzibar day one available left close midnight would arrive next morning lie waited bit went another desk person found flight leaving evening though still spent hour airport would get u zanzibar p leaving airport zanzibar return flight sept personnel counter precision air would print boarding pass told u get desk nairobi hr min layover immediately went desk get ticket course queue long half customer ignored walked right desk kenya airline employee seem care first group arrived desk still minute flight left already spent minute line horrible time management inefficiency staff arrived desk gentleman told u missed flight still minute get flight already checked checked zanzibar airport told u even first line desk plane landed hour takeoff still would able board plane would sell u ticket kenya airway website fraud entire time talking desk people randomly talking customer walked like outraged lady supposed going one location kenya airway attendant booked wrong country really blame checking phone essentially atrocious customer service representative imaginable flippant care make long story shorter stuck airport midnight moved hotel returned next morning afternoon flight course delayed couple time flight attendant wonderful though none entertainment system worked flight would recommend airline unless literally option

245,"Very impressed with the service offered on these flights. We had missed our booked flight (ET direct from Djibouti to Addis Ababa) so re-booked at the last minute onto Kenya Airways. Even at this late stage, the fare was good and we departed a few hours later than originally planned. The aircraft was clean with comfortable seats (much better than ET on similar routes) and drinks and a small meal were served. All of excellent quality. On the first sector, the crew was headed up by a Purser who was excellent in his customer service and clear announcements in both French and English. The crew had a good sense of humour and were ready to assist in whatever way they could. Transit was via the new airport terminal in Nairobi. One word: Wow! This terminal is exceptional and must be the easiest to navigate, most comfortable I have experienced on the continent. It beats JNB, CPT and others hands-down. Processing was swift and comfortable, shops were open as were a selection of restaurants. There is clearly more to come from this airport as a number of shops seem to be preparing to open. Gate rooms are open and comfortable with access to bathrooms nearby. Fantastic new airport! Our onward flight to Addis was also good. We had to wait for a large party of late passengers but the crew were thoughtful enough to offer us a glass of water or orange juice while we awaited the late-comers. Much appreciated.

249,"I have flown with Kenya Airways before and would describe them as being cheap and cheerful with slightly above average service. Flights to Johannesburg were on time however they ran out of meal choices and we were left with a rather disgusting fish affair. I had chosen Kenya Airways primarily because of their generous baggage allowance ie 2 x 23kg bags as we were bringing sports equipment and motorcycle gear on our holiday. All went reasonably well even given the poor meals on the outbound flight however coming back was a different matter. When we arrived at Johannesburg Airport we were faced with a huge set of scales placed in front of the check in counter that also had its own usual scales. We had to have our bags weighed and the very over officious clerk refused to take my bags as one was 3kg overweight never mind the fact that my other bag was 4kg under weight. I would have understood the concerns if the total of my bags were overweight but they weren't and despite my appeals for a more common sense approach and despite my bags being identically packed to the outward journey (where they were checked in at Heathrow with no problem) I had to repack my luggage on the check in floor. This in my view is a totally ridiculous rule that appears to only be applied at Johannesburg (I have flown Kenya Airways from London, Mombasa and Nairobi on several occasions without any inconvenience). On the flight to Nairobi they again ran out of food choices and we were served by a very rude steward who just slammed the food if you can call it that down in front of us. When we arrived in Nairobi they were bussing those ending their journey there to the terminal but there were no directions for those transitting, we managed to find an emergency exit and took that and were lucky to find a very impatient Kenya Airways employee who directed us to cross a busy airport road in the dark. There was no pedestrian crossing markings and she had no high vis gear on, we were lucky not to get run down by a bus that came around the corner suddenly. The onward flight to Heathrow passed without further incident however the breakfast served was appalling, a piece of unidentifiable gristle in the dish, truly the worst meal I have ever been served in over 50 years of flying.

250,"Flew from London Heathrow to Entebbe via Nairobi. Arrived early for check-in but then had to wait because one of the desks was being occupied by a family who were not travelling business but seemed to be negotiating over buying another ticket. I had booked both tickets and had selected adjoining seats but by the time we had checked in these have been changed. Even though I had paid for the tickets, I was told that I could not be told whether my travelling companion was still sitting next to me – data protection etc. in fact he had been put elsewhere. It was only at the gate that we managed to correct the problem. The aircraft was a newish Boeing 787 Dreamliner and although Kenya Airways had not opted for a more modern seat configuration, it was a relatively comfortable. A slightly larger pillow would have been appreciated. My IFE was not working (photo) although given that I wanted to sleep I was not particularly worried. The cabin crew apologised for not having a printed menu and instead let the passengers look at what appeared to be an email with the food options. The wine was uninspiring and the food lacklustre. However, the cabin crew were excellent: some of them had a slightly mischievous sense of humour, smiling and responded quickly to requests. Arriving at Nairobi was a disaster. First, the aircraft had to be towed in because of construction work and we were then put on a bus and taken to the arrivals terminal. There were no signs for transit passengers and when we asked, we were told that we had arrived at the wrong place. Needless to say nobody bothered to tell us. We then went on another bus and after an absurdly long wait finally got through security. The business lounge in Nairobi was small and we were forced to share a table. We decided to leave early and, eventually, the next flight, to Entebbe, was called. Absolutely no priority was given to business passengers. Although there was a separate line, passengers simply joined whichever was the shortest and the staff did nothing to ensure that those who had paid a premium were given priority treatment. We realise that running an airline involves juggling numerous different priorities and not every airline can aspire to the standards of Emirates or Qatar Airways, but with a little effort, and a negligible cost, Kenya Airways could have done considerably better than this.",2016-03-05,False,flew london heathrow entebbe via nairobi arrived early check wait one desk occupied family travelling business seemed negotiating buying another ticket booked ticket selected adjoining seat time checked changed even though paid ticket told could told whether travelling companion still sitting next data protection etc fact put elsewhere gate managed correct problem aircraft newish boeing dreamliner although kenya airway opted modern seat configuration relatively comfortable slightly larger pillow would appreciated ife working photo although given wanted sleep particularly worried cabin crew apologised printed menu instead let passenger look appeared email food option wine uninspiring food lacklustre however cabin crew excellent slightly mischievous sense humour smiling responded quickly request arriving nairobi disaster first aircraft towed construction work put bus taken arrival terminal sign transit passenger asked told arrived wrong place needle say nobody bothered tell u went another bus absurdly long wait finally got security business lounge nairobi small forced share table decided leave early eventually next flight entebbe called absolutely priority given business passenger although separate line passenger simply joined whichever shortest staff nothing ensure paid premium given priority treatment realise running airline involves juggling numerous different priority every airline aspire standard emirate qatar airway little effort negligible cost kenya airway could done considerably better

258,"London to Lilongwe via Nairobi. I've been flying with Kenya Airways for close to 10 years (after BA stopped flying directly to Malawi). I've enjoyed comfortable leg room and services at most times. But this trip was just terrible. After an 8hr+ flight, they had a 6 hour wait for connection for 12.35pm. Then when it was about 1.30h to go, it was cancelled without any sensible reason. Having been tired, I was angry by their lack of communication. They compensated with a hotel booking about 20-30min away. The hotel was comfortable and had excellent services. We were taken back to the airport for a 10pm flight naturally expecting to be in Lilongwe by just after midnight. To my horror this wasn't a direct flight, but was going through Zimbabwe first then back to Lilongwe (no sense in this whatsoever). To make it worse, it didn't leave until 11.15pm. During all this there was no apology or anything. I've noticed this is becoming very common with their flights to Malawi apparently where they cancel or delay without thought. I regret not buying insurance because I would have claimed. For a such a good airline doing well for Africa, it's really a pity. If South African Airways had favourable luggage allowance for their heavy price, I would have switched.

262,"I don't even know where to start. I lost two days of my vacation due to flight delays from Douala to Dubai and Kenyan Airways gave the worst experience so far. When I was checking-in at the counter, I was quite pleased with a very helpful local ground staff. Before I left, I gave him 5000 CFA as a tip. The flight was delayed 6 hours so I checked in late as well. Suddenly, the staff was asking furiously for additional money because his superior saw him receiving a tip and he had to share the tip with others (couldn't believe) this really happened. He was bugging me in the most creepy way possible so I just decided to give another 5000 and left.  I was supposed to leave Douala at 1PM but we were only informed at around 4PM that they had to check us in overnight because there were some mechanical glitches with their plane. They checked us in at 2-star hotel in Douala for twin sharing-room! The room was like crate. We were finally picked up by van and we headed back to the airport. We boarded one hour late and because we were delayed for one day and I had a couple of connecting flights, my entire flight schedule got messed up. It seemed we were hostaged - not being histrionic but that was the feeling. They didn't issue a new plane ticket and asked us to claim the next ticket in Nairobi. So when we were supposed to catch the next flight from Nairobi to Dubai, we were a few minutes late and we weren't able to catch the flight. After 30 minutes of looking for somebody who can provide us information on how do we board the next flight, we were finally advised that we had to stay overnight in Nairobi and check-in at the hotel - again. There were three of us who were supposed to fly to Dubai. We insisted that they book us Etihad as it was the closest flight that time. They told us that they couldn't book another airline because it would be more expensive for them. They advised us instead that we could book and reimburse the expenses from them (yes, so if you like taking chances, one can consider). So we finally settled to stay overnight after they told us that we would be billeted on a 5-star hotel. We finally arrived at the ""5-star hotel"" only there was no air-conditioning. Yes, a hotel without an AC but a fan. We left Nairobi the following day and flew to Dubai. As soon as I get to Dubai, I requested my travel agent to cancel my return flight and reimburse me with my return flight. They offered instead that they would upgrade my cabin class to business for my return trip. The return trip had minimal delays and the business class experience was ok. But when I landed in Douala my luggage was missing! They told us that our luggage were left behind in Nairobi so we will have to wait the next day to get our luggage.

However on the outbound journey none of the seat-back TVs worked in the centre and right hand seats most were just dead others flickered fitfully and most annoying my screen just wouldn't turn off.

287,I recently flew MAN to MBA via AMS and NBO. Overall a very pleasant flight. All flights took off and landed on time. I'll only mention the AMS to NBO to MBA sections because they were all Kenya flights. The 777-300 ER from AMS to NBO had the 3-3-3 arrangement which meant a little more room than I usually get on other airlines. The food was decent enough the wine ok and plenty off it. The service although not perfect was fine. The IFE is not upto Emirates quality but since I don't sit for the entire flight the movie choice was ok. The flight from NBO to MBA was on a well equipped Embraer 190 which even had its own IFE quite a novelty on a short hop flight and something I've never seen in Europe. The only fly in the ointment was NBO but that is not the airlines fault that's KAA's issue. Its a bit of a nightmare for an international arrival with a domestic transfer. But overall a decent flight I would certainly fly them again.,2014-11-06,False,recently flew man mba via am nbo overall pleasant flight flight took landed time mention am nbo mba section kenya flight er am nbo arrangement meant little room usually get airline food decent enough wine ok plenty service although perfect fine ife upto emirate quality since sit entire flight movie choice ok flight nbo mba well equipped embraer even ife quite novelty short hop flight something never seen europe fly ointment nbo airline fault kaa issue bit nightmare international arrival domestic transfer overall decent flight would certainly fly

289,Flew from NBO to Jo'burg with friends on golfing holiday (Group of 12). We fly KQ a lot in Kenya and we all knew it's a horrible airline before we booked but we did not have much choice and were ok because KQ normally fly golf bags for free. Nope - they've changed their minds on this route and tried to sting us each for $120 excess baggage. One couple paid and the rest of us refused - they finally let us on because we were holding up the check-in for everyone else. No in-flight entertainment of course but flight was actually on time which is a nice change for KQ. My wife and I booked our seats in advance but found they had been given up to others (part of my group so we did not make a fuss) and my wife and were given seats two rows apart. Luckily other people were prepared to swap so we could sit together. Hopelessly unprofessional airline from time of booking to time of landing but what can you do? I'd never fly KQ if I had a choice. Flight back was exactly the same except they let us bring our clubs for free because we had a letter from the tour operator saying we were entitled.,2014-09-14,False,flew nbo jo burg friend golfing holiday group fly kq lot kenya knew horrible airline booked much choice ok kq normally fly golf bag free nope changed mind route tried sting u excess baggage one couple paid rest u refused finally let u holding check everyone else flight entertainment course flight actually time nice change kq wife booked seat advance found given others part group make fuss wife given seat two row apart luckily people prepared swap could sit together hopelessly unprofessional airline time booking time landing never fly kq choice flight back exactly except let u bring club free letter tour operator saying entitled

291,I flew Business Class from Bangkok to Nairobi and it was one of my worst flight experiences. The Business Class cabin was virtually empty 3 other passengers. The food was the same as Economy a chicken/patty/hamburger with overcooked vegetables and none of the wines on the impressive wine list were available - only the NZ Chardonnay they were serving in Economy. The IFE did not work which I reported to the Purser - was on the same plane same seat on return journey - still not working. On arrival at Nairobi I was woken on final approach - no time for even a cup of coffee. The stewardess said she had not wanted to wake me - but had not asked the night before if I would be wanting breakfast.

292,Our flight from Guangzhou to Bangkok was cancelled. This is actually not something unusual. However the handling of this situation by the local staff was an absolute disaster. Initially the flight was delayed for three hours until they eventually made the decision to cancel it. We were put up in a below average hotel and left in the dark about further arrangements. The next day we called them every half hour but they themselves did not know what went on. Furthermore they told us that we could not easily get our luggage. In the end I had to get very angry. Only then did they become more co-operative. However the pilot did not allow the luggage to be released from the airport until the afternoon of the next day. Due to this we almost missed the next flight.

293,"Flew return London to Nairobi with ""The Pride of Africa"". The website is amateur looking and booking a seat is confusing. I did book with a travel agent and they said we would have to pay for extra legroom seats. However when I logged on I discovered row 33 DFG were all free to book with extra leg room. The service was basic food was bad my entertainment system was old and did not work  when I asked a member of staff to look they just walked off. So 8 hours with no entertainment system the fact I had legroom helped me to relax. A man sitting next to me said their entertainment systems quite often do not work. Staff looked like they did not want to be there. On Returning from Zanzibar we were told we would have to pay $100 each for extra leg room.

294,We have been using KQ for the past 14 years out of Malawi and it is a love/hate relationship. I trust the pilots and the airline technicians. If KQ management would go the extra step they would graduate into another category. However very often its the individual flight attendants that keep me booking and flying KQ. We flew Economy and Business - both with different experiences. I was about not to book KQ anymore until the new dreamliner came in. Nice aircraft - friendly crew. The inflight service needs improvement. I have had better service in Economy than in Business class at times. The inflight entertainment program and equipment did not work on previous flights (both classes) except the new planes. Would I fly KQ again? Yes but if I can fly KLM equipment I would chose KLM because it is predictable in terms of standard and quality.

Over the last few years things have been going steadily downhill and over the last few trip I have done with them they have reached new depths. The in-flight entertainment system simply does not work on the London-Nairobi flight and the aircrew are clearly aware that the system has simply died.

304,I flew LHR-NBO return and was generally satisfied by the service. It's nothing special but the 777 are relatively comfortable (showing some sign of age) - the best feature in both directions was that there were plenty of spare seats so passengers were able to spread out and I found the overnight timings most convenient. I found the food and drink poor however (particularly hard to face food overstrained tea and vile juice) and the in-flight entertainment distinctly average (limited range of films poor sound quality broken in several seats). Basically it's an acceptable in-flight experience that gets you efficiently from A to B and the ground experience is much more professional/competent than many other African airlines from my experience. Staff were generally friendly (with exception of some check-in staff at NBO who were grumpy).,2014-06-10,False,flew lhr nbo return generally satisfied service nothing special relatively comfortable showing sign age best feature direction plenty spare seat passenger able spread found overnight timing convenient found food drink poor however particularly hard face food overstrained tea vile juice flight entertainment distinctly average limited range film poor sound quality broken several seat basically acceptable flight experience get efficiently b ground experience much professional competent many african airline experience staff generally friendly exception check staff nbo grumpy

I approach it as super premium economy with some business perks and I am not disappointed. I rarely watch in-flight entertainment but it doesn't work sometimes - that is a fact. Don't expect too much in terms of communication if there is trouble but they have generally been okay with us. Only one serious delay in 8 years (door wouldn't close) and we were treated okay in Business (slow but sure) but the economy passengers were left at the gate all night with minimal information late refreshments and little help. Basically they were dumped because Kenya Airways only had enough staff left on duty to take care of us and they had to wait until we were shuttled off to our hotel before they got any attention.,2014-05-25,False,flown number time bangkok nairobi route mixed set experience seat good sleeping food edible mostly approach super premium economy business perk disappointed rarely watch flight entertainment work sometimes fact expect much term communication trouble generally okay u one serious delay year door close treated okay business slow sure economy passenger left gate night minimal information late refreshment little help basically dumped kenya airway enough staff left duty take care u wait shuttled hotel got attention

Of course it had been prepared for our flight but not well enough - the toilet I used even before departure was grubby the carpeting on the floor of the passenger cabin still had tiny remnants of a food spill from the previous flight the inflight entertainment system worked only partly - the flight tracker did not work at all throughout the 8 hr flight to Amsterdam - the choice in movies and music was so limited and the sound quality so inadequate.

There were a lot of Chinese/Thai flight attendants to deal with the Chinese/Thai speaking passengers. Hand luggage size rules were (generally) obeyed by passengers. Flight arrived about an hour early. FA's were friendly and had good English. Good selection of beverages (and generous amounts). Food was also good. Leg room and seat width was adequate. Good magazine. A few noticeable issues: The turning off of electronic devices prior to takeoff and landing was not enforced by staff and staff were also not strict enough with regards to passengers standing up going to the toilets etc. during taxiing. There could have been more thorough pre-takeoff and pre-landing aisle checks for seat belts etc. by the FA's. Sometimes there were no announcements by FA's when the seatbelt sign was turned on by the captain during turbulence and passengers of whom disobeyed the sign were not told to hurry up and sit down - people continued to move around the cabin. There were seat back TV's (channels) but the content was not working (blank black screens on all channels except for the flight data). FA's were notified but could not be fixed. The safety video needs updating and the audio from the loudspeakers was too soft. There were no night aisle walks by FA's with water/juice - they seemed to disappear after the meal service.

322,Flight from NBO to MSA. Good experience and seem like high standards. Used the SIMBA lounge as well. There was a huge storm in NBO and the staff checked and rechecked the boarding passes. An elderly lady was in a wheelchair and couldn't don the plastic raincoats they gave us for the trip to the plane (no passenger loader). No one helped her with the raincoat. I helped her and then asked the KQ Staff to help out. They just stood around I guess expecting to be told what to do? Another check by the loading stairs then another check at the entrance of the aircraft with lines forming and people getting wet.

327,Terrible experience with Kenya Airways. Flew from London to Nairobi in September. After losing our luggage they didn't seem very concerned or willing to help. We had to keep complaining to get them to do anything and kept getting passed from one employee to another. The next morning we had to fly from Nairobi to Kilimanjaro on Precision Air which is a subsidiary of Kenya Airways and got bumped from our flight until 12 hours later. Then they didn't take anyone's luggage on the flight! They told us that the luggage would arrive the next day but it didn't arrive until 4 days later. By that time we were on Mount Kilimanjaro using rented and purchased gear. At no time did the airline offer to reimburse us. Finally at the end of our trip we had to fly on Kenya airways from Nairobi to London. We arrived at the airport 3 hours before the flight and when we checked in the agent told us we were on standby! We created a big enough stink that they gave us our boarding passes. Then the flight was 3 hours late departing. Also on both Air Kenya flights the food wasn't very good and the inflight entertainment units didn't work well. If we ever fly back to Africa we would never fly Kenya Airways again.,2013-11-04,False,ble experience kenya airway flew london nairobi september losing luggage seem concerned willing help keep complaining get anything kept getting passed one employee another next morning fly nairobi kilimanjaro precision air subsidiary kenya airway got bumped flight hour later take anyone luggage flight told u luggage would arrive next day arrive day later time mount kilimanjaro using rented purchased gear time airline offer reimburse u finally end trip fly kenya airway nairobi london arrived airport hour flight checked agent told u standby created big enough stink gave u boarding pass flight hour late departing also air kenya flight food good inflight entertainment unit work well ever fly back africa would never fly kenya airway

330,NBO-EDL-NBO. Domestic flights all on time. Due to the newly burnt NBO airport boarding was primitive and lengthy and we were 5-10 passengers who lost our flight due to lack of calls for boarding other routes were announced clearly. As there was a mess in the temporarily domestic airport there were no facilities no signboard nor search for passengers. Strangely enough my luggage was unloaded (correctly) but I was furious as I was accused for No Show despite sitting straight in front of the only exit way in the tent where all domestic passengers had to walk through to their flights. However some apology was received and they rebooked me instantly for the following morning but only as a “prioritized waitlist passenger. However I got the last seat and was pleased to eventually get it. Otherwise all flights on time pleasant FA-service and good announcements on board.

Seats were extremely uncomfortable and I could feel springs. Most airline food is never very good but this was awful it was very over cooked and was all stuck together. NBO-LHR departed over an hour late as aircraft was parked at the wrong part of the airport so we were made to sit in a tent on the apron in darkness until someone got fuel for a generator once on the aircraft it was again a rather tired 777-200 ER and was again in a seat which probably hasn't seen a cushion in 10 years! NVOD still didn't work which made for a long flight. Food was marginally better. Again I cannot fault cabin crew who were very attentive.

NRB-AMS-USA flight had the worst meals: breakfast croissant and bread. FA's appeared tired and bothered when requested for anything especially water.

333,Overnight flight to Nairobi from Schipol. Seating was very uncomfortable where sleep was near impossible. Service onboard was attentive. On the return flight to Schipol I found the food tray to be dirty. Service was reasonable but not as good as the outbound flight.

No PTVs in Business Class but I slept almost the entire flight. Service was great. Had an 8 hour layover in Amsterdam. Nightmare began when boarding the AMS-NBO flight. Plane was a moderate Boeing 777-200ER. Garbage all over the floor no PTVs seats that can't recline for standard Business Class and some broken tray tables. Left an hour late. The food for Business Class looked like plastic and it somewhat tasted like plastic. Arrived 15 minutes late the next morning. Nairobi's airport was in very poor shape. NBO-JNB - Luckily it was the gate next to where I arrived. Flight was operated by an old Boeing 737-700. Seats better than AMS-NBO flight cabin clean but some tray tables were missing. Flight delayed because of morning traffic congestion. Flight attendants very polite. Arrived later than scheduled. On the return the JNB-NBO flight wasn't delayed but the Boeing 737-700 was awful. The next day we board at around 8am but the plane wasn't even at the gate. A replacement airplane a very poor looking Boeing 767-300ER was towed to the gate at 9.00. Boarded at 9.45 and left at 10.15. Served the worst breakfast and lunch. Arrived an hour late in Amsterdam. Had a 5 hour layover waiting to travel with KLM. Aircraft was a new Airbus A330-200.

Felt like there was no padding and my seat cushion slipped forward revealing the metal base of the seat. Very uncomfortable. Inflight service did not work. No matter how many times they rebooted it certain seats were still no-ops. Headphones were falling apart and the one pair that was not was of no use as the socket on the seat I was sitting in and the one next to me was broken.

I booked to fly KLM for both out and inbound journeys but unfortunately found myself obliged to fly KQ for the return seats and fittings equally dilapidated as the KQ flight to Paris that I now systematically avoid. Inflight entertainment was simply missing. I didn't think any airline would put these kind of flights on popular international routes. 2 hrs after take-off the breakfast trolley is rolling past 1 hour later flight attendant offers me a tray with bread croissant butter and juice announcing continental breakfast. Half an hour later I'm still waiting for a hot drink. In the meantime the captain is apologising about late take-off from Nairobi as if it was something to be proud of. Tea eventually comes 1 hour after 'continental breakfast'. Incidentally the temperatures in the cabin is kept glacial. This is nothing compared to lunch. After a terribly long wait to only to end up with a repeat of the earlier back and forth game of trolleys and trays partially empty trays trays with this or that missing. My salad comes with the inside of the already unsealed lid smeared with what looks like chocolate pudding? We are a long cry from the fancy looking menu proudly presented at the onset of flight.

354,We flew from Heathrow to Nairobi on 4th Sep with the flight leaving on time. We managed to get extra legroom seats (row 12) as my husband is 6 ft. 5 and they were fine. Boarding was fairly structured and the food (an evening meal - I chose the veggie option - stuffed peppers) was pretty good - hot and tasty with a snack just before landing for breakfast. I didn't expect much from the IFE from the reviews and wasn't bothered anyway. Some parts of the cabin were a bit frayed around the edges but no real complaints. Crew were fairly attentive. Both internal flights were also fine - a short hop between Nairobi and Mombassa and vice versa - the first left early the second a few minutes late.

Flying back on 13th from Nairobi to Heathrow was fine too - left on time but no extra legroom seats this time so a bit cramped for my husband.

Boarding this time was a bit more chaotic and JKIA is a horrible airport - cramped chaotic and poor flight information. Luggage all arrived with no problems too.

I say ""unfortunately"" mainly due to the more than frequent delays without explanations without anyone responsible and without real support as to what to do. You feel totally lost in the horrible JKIA. When flights get delayed over night people are ferried to hotels in CBD instead of hotels closer to the airport. Apart from this standing joke on KQ unreliability of flights I have to say that I have always received my luggage (touch wood). In-flight entertainment is a complete joke with old movies on the system that only works half the time. Twice in business NBO-Paris I had no in-flight entertainment at all and no apologies for it. Food is not too bad. Seats are old and uncomfortable.

However from HKG-BKK-HKG it was clean efficient and with good service. Outbound flight delayed by 45 minutes but inward was on time. Luggage and check-in fast and efficient too (although couldn't check-in online). The price we paid made this a budget airline purchase effectively and we treated as such.

What exactly is happening - now informed that the Johannesburg-Nairobi 10.55 never actually exist and has never flown - but KQ will nevertheless book you on this flight and demand USD 80 for any attempt to change!

But Kenya Airways kept telling us we would depart every 3 hours until 1am when passengers became angry and had to storm the First Class lounge of Kenya Airways so someone from Management could be called to explain the reason for the long delay. Needless to say no one showed up. Some passengers with children have been stuck at the airport for 2 days. Some passengers - not all have been given food.

Chief FA then informs passengers that another 10 passengers have to be offloaded. Eventually all passengers had to disembark the aircraft and re-board so calculations could be reconciled with the regulations. At 16.30 after a frustrating 3 hour wait I voluntarily disembarked was taken to the baggage hall to collect my bag only to find all passengers’ baggage had not even been loaded onto the aircraft.

405,As per the previous review I was traveling on the cancelled 2345 flight from Nairobi to Heathrow as part of a round trip. The flights in both directions were reasonably good the entertainment systems were broken for most of the seats but staff were pleasant and helpful and food was good. Unfortunately the reaction to the cancelled flight was awful and the worst treatment I have ever received from an airline. As the previous reviewer says the staff were very slow extremely ill informed and seem to have lied on occasion. Almost no effort was made to inform passengers as to what they needed to do in terms of changing flights getting back through immigration control and sorting out a hotel. This resulted in a great deal of frustration and wasted time queuing in the wrong places. In particular the airline made very little effort to help passengers find hotel accommodation; only one member of staff was available to help and passengers including us were told that there was no hotel accommodation left available which was later proved to be untrue when a number of passengers complained and were miraculously found hotel rooms. I suspect the lack of hotel rooms may have related rather more to a lack of appetite to pay the room rates rather than any genuine shortage. Ultimately we along with perhaps a third of the passengers ended up sleeping on the floor of the transit lounge until we were told to get up and move at around 6am. The re-scheduled flight was then further delayed when the first officer did not turn up for work at this point refreshments were provided but not enough for all the passengers. All in all a consistent and depressing display of incompetence.,2011-10-23,False,per previous review traveling cancelled flight nairobi heathrow part round trip flight direction reasonably good entertainment system broken seat staff pleasant helpful food good unfortunately reaction cancelled flight awful worst treatment ever received airline previous reviewer say staff slow extremely ill informed seem lied occasion almost effort made inform passenger needed term changing flight getting back immigration control sorting hotel resulted great deal frustration wasted time queuing wrong place particular airline made little effort help passenger find hotel accommodation one member staff available help passenger including u told hotel accommodation left available later proved untrue number passenger complained miraculously found hotel room suspect lack hotel room may related rather lack appetite pay room rate rather genuine shortage ultimately along perhaps third passenger ended sleeping floor transit lounge told get move around scheduled flight delayed first officer turn work point refreshment provided enough passenger consistent depressing display incompetence
406,Nairobi-LHR. I recently was unfortunate to have flown Kenya Airways. Flying Nairobi to Heathrow on the 23.45 flight we were told after we had all proceeded through the gate that it had been cancelled. This was at midnight. 2 staff were available to book over 200 people onto new flights. They were slow rude and lied about when they were able to do. They were very slow to provide any refreshments and were not able to accommodate everyone in hotels until the flights the following day - so we had to sleep on the floor. When I finally got a flight home the food was substandard the staff were rude and surly. Toilets were not cleaned or maintained.

Arrived at Ivato 8.30am check-in didn't open till 10.15am. Once checked in to Nairobi I was casually told that my London connection was booked for two days later.

409,I write this sitting in an airport lounge having just disembarked from the only trip that I have ever taken using Kenya Airways - it is awful! The outbound flight there was no individual entertainment system just a single main screen movie that was impossible to watch. The seats were uncomfortable. Food awful and not enough. The return flight used a newer aircraft but that only meant that the seats were even closer together making it a long and painful trip. Even though the newer aircraft had individual entertainment system it was lacking features and mine did not work. They could not even turn it off so that I could sleep so I had this white screen glaring at me all through the night. The crew are poor - 10 minutes before landing I asked what terminal we would arrive at and they did not know.

On the trip north a small snack at the start of the trip and a small breakfast at the end. The cabin crew was fine. The plane was in good condition. The entertainment system had limited range of programs. The only major issue was the boarding procedure at Nairobi airport. The passengers were squeezed into a tiny departure lounge for a long time.

420,We were quite disappointed by our first experience of Kenya Airways on our recent trip from London to Nairobi - my husband's TV wasn't working and although we asked for help that was simply ignored. The staff looked bored and were not very attentive. You had to be quick to say that you wanted coffee/tea as you only had one chance much too early during dinner. The food wasn't great but edible. I was also annoyed by the fact that they didn't encourage other passengers to put their seats forward when food was served - that meant we had even less space whilst having our breakfast. The flight back was not quite as bad but still I felt the staff could have made more of an effort (occasional smile would be nice). The thing I would really like to criticise was the boarding procedure at Nairobi airport - we were asked to board 1.5 hours before departure which meant that we were squeezed into a tiny departure lounge for that length of time - the boarding was a mess with the announcements and ground staff contradicting each other - despite the early 'boarding time' we still managed to leave late.,2011-08-07,False,quite disappointed first experience kenya airway recent trip london nairobi husband tv working although asked help simply ignored staff looked bored attentive quick say wanted coffee tea one chance much early dinner food great edible also annoyed fact encourage passenger put seat forward food served meant even le space whilst breakfast flight back quite bad still felt staff could made effort occasional smile would nice thing would really like criticise boarding procedure nairobi airport asked board hour departure meant squeezed tiny departure lounge length time boarding mess announcement ground staff contradicting despite early boarding time still managed leave late

There was one starter (no choice) choice of 2 main courses and then desert or cheese (pre-plated). Wine was excellent. Service was good. Glasses were always topped up. We never use KQ IFE.

NBO-JNB was a different story. Upon arrival at Nairobi Airport I was informed that I had been re-booked on a later flight instead. As a result the boarding process took a long time and the flight was delayed about 30mins. The 767 used on this leg was in good shape with a smart blue leather interior and a good seat pitch.

430,"Nairobi-London. Lounge in Nairobi was small and food poor but for Nairobi Airport standards it was ok. Very surprised they only started boarding 25mins before departure (usually it's much earlier) but we managed to leave bang on time. Welcome by Cabin Crew was warm. Seat was comfortable in sitting position. Seat nice and wide. When converted into a bed it's angle is 170 degrees but you can't stretch your legs fully (and I'm only 5'8) which means any position for a long period of time is uncomfortable. In flight entertainment was poor - AVOD but very limited selection of films. Lots of features seemed to be broken - whether it was the control or the individual system it was unclear. Food was a mixture - lunch was excellent beautifully presented but the Afternoon tea (which they copied it seems from BA) was appalling - sandwiches were dry rolls with slabs of butter and unidentifiable filling. Scone was cold and dry. Cabin Crew were good but not excellent - they were courteous and warm but very slow which was disappointing as the cabin was almost empty so they had only a few passengers to serve and it still took an age for them to respond to any request or to complete each round of the meal service. I would be very frustrated if the cabin had been full. Disappointingly there was absolutely no interaction with pax from crew. Overall the flight was reasonably comfortable and smooth but not good value for money.

431,Nairobi-London. As me and my wife are both wheelchair passengers (for which we charged $10 each by the Nairobi office it was a very disappointing experience at London Heathrow. There were no wheelchairs on arrival at Heathrow. I had to wait 40 mins before the ground staff could arrange for a wheelchair or a buggy. In the end we had to walk half the distance with one wheel chair for me (no wheel chair for my wife! although $10 was paid). There was no inflight entertainment I tried to talk to the purser but he/she did not bother. We have flown Kenya Airways many times and competition airlines as well. Seems that the airline in looking for profits is ignoring the comfort of passengers (although a shareholder of the company I do not expect the service to be comprised) to support our national airline. Another area I would like to point out is no refresher kit is given to Economy Class passengers.
