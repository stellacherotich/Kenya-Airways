0,"Not Verified |  The lady at check-in was very rude and insisted on wanting to check in my colleague on a 4am flight with no alternative accommodation but a mere 200usd and we  rejected the offer as it excluded accommodation. She refused to call the manager when we requested her to and brazenly carried on until we confronted her again. Only after waiting for 55 minutes then my colleague's seat was secured and we went through the boarding gates. As if that wasn't enough, the departure time was 30min late and no apology was received from the captain. To use Kenya Airways was the biggest blunder on my side ever committed. I am a frequent flyer and have never experienced such a distasteful and shabby treatment ever. I vow never to use this airline again.",26th August 2023
1,"✅ Trip Verified |  Dismal from start to end. Not all of the staff and crew were rude, some were just sullen and disinterested. Food was consistently awful, drinks were ok. The hard product isn’t too bad (similar to what Turkish used to operate, i.e. dated, but comfortable enough), but everything else was dreadful - checkin, lounges, boarding etc, all service points were very poor. Nairobi airport was an awful experience all 4 times (we had stopovers in both directions), expect corruption, chaos and disorganisation. I’ll do all I can to avoid Kenya Airways in future.",23rd August 2023
2,"Not Verified | Airline was 1 hour late to board passengers and to 1 hour late to depart without any explanation. Food was horrible, and to make matters worse, they lost the entire passengers' luggage without any explanation. The Swiss Port employee who was left to deal with the passengers had no clue what was going on and all he could do was give us forms to fill out. All perishable items that I carried will now be trashed since the man said the earliest we could get our bags is Wednesday 8/24. A passenger on the same flight who had air tagged her luggage indicated that the bag was still at JKIA! Last month they also lost my husband's luggage and when they tracked it, it was discovered to be at the Delta baggage office still in New York instead of Kenya. 4 days later when it was delivered. They did not even bother to refund us.",22nd August 2023
3,"✅ Trip Verified |  Kenya Airways has really disappointed me for a second time, it's never on time, it appears 30_40 minutes late. Am supposed to be setting off to Uganda from Kenya but the plane is not even here. Same applies from Dubai we left 26 minutes late that was even before we boarded. ",19th August 2023
4,"✅ Trip Verified |  JNB-NBO-AMS-ZRH on 14-15 August 23. Flights on time, despite being quite full. Good announcements. Check in on transfer desk in Jo-burg, all 3 BPs issued on spot. Kenya now uses the South African Airlines lounge, which is very high class lounge with sleepers and a very diverse buffet with high quality foods. The long haul flights were both on Boeing 787-9, business class is wonderfully furnished, spacious, in 2x2x2 configuration which is perfect. Low chair fenders allow you to overlook entire cabin when seated upright. Very ample leg space in the lie-flats. Spent night in Pride lounge, Nairobi. Preordered, hot seafood meals were provided thrice on the two flights, all different variants and tasty. Take-off champagne given. Not the most sublime business class catering in the skies: food in general is not extraordinary (apart from the pre-order options), no beer choices, only the watery national Tusker Lager offered. Meals robust and reliable, pre-ordered meal managed well. FAs active and smiley, though not well coordinated, despite being many. IFE is acceptable though narrow choices on movies. Nice beds with mattresses and pillows, 2 blankets per seat. Will fly again with KQ. KLMs 52 lounge in Amsterdam is huge and good, they printed out coming Boarding Passes for me. Amsterdam-Zurich on Embraer 190 aircraft operated by KLM, well synchronised with Kenya Airways and under their flight number. Flight full. Delayed ½ hour due to complicated, tedious loading of two giant dogs, a serious unnecessary delay causing delay for 200 people. Catering was surprisingly good: menu card, nice, large food box with 3 course meal, including my favoured seafood meal. Champagne, 4 wines, and lots of hot and soft drinks offered. Swift service. Seats are just economy seats but I was given 2 seats in front row and can’t complain.",18th August 2023
5,✅ Trip Verified | Officially the worlds worst airline. 3hr + delay from SA to Burundi and coming home they call you to board and then tell you your flight is delayed by 2hrs+. No compensation. Rude cheeky staff with no customer service. They try to push the blame to customers and have a serious attitude issue. Everything about the airline is so disappointing from the aircraft to the meals to the staff to the compensation. Been on the airport for more than 10hrs. No empathy for ppl. They tell you to book a hotel at your own expense and they can’t even accommodate ppl in lounges. Pathetic. Stay away from this airline.,7th August 2023
6,"Not Verified |  The worst service I have ever encountered in airline, my fiancé missed her flight 4 times due to overbooking of airline. Airport workers keep on sending her back home saying that the airplane is full, I wonder how if you can treat your staff like that? How can you put up to 7 passengers waiting for more than 4 days or why would you issue staff tickets yet you know the plane is full? 30 minutes Before the gates closes the we can see that you can even issue tickets, the flight has up to 10 seats free and still you decide not to give your staff a seat? I do not ever recommend anyone to use Kenya airways",31st July 2023
7,"✅ Trip Verified | Do not use Kenya Airways! This was the worst decision I’ve ever made, I had two flights one from Mombasa to Nairobi which was delayed 4 hours so I almost “missed” my second flight home to London then I got there and they delayed it by an hour meaning it was 12:55pm then they told us they were delaying it till the next day at midday. The organisation was appalling. Got to a hotel room at 4am which wasn’t cleaned at all and they didn't even give me a key card for my hotel room. The flight then also got delayed another 2 hours the next day.",27th July 2023
8,✅ Trip Verified |  I had the worst experience with them I cant even explain my frustration. The night of my departure they told us 2 hours delay then another 3 hours then they said you know what it's cancelled. They booked me another flight the next day I reached to Dubai and the next flight was already gone by then. ,22nd July 2023
9,"✅ Trip Verified |  We travelled from Mauritius to South Africa, with a connection flight in Nairobi. In Mauritius we've checked in all 3 of our bags at the same time. Upon arrival in Johannesburg, South Africa, we were informed that my son's bag stayed behind in Mauritius. They've done a tracking on the barcode, and informed us that the bag never arrived in Nairobi either. How can you just leave the bag behind? Pathetic service!",8th July 2023
10,"✅ Trip Verified | 
We had flown in from Dubai to Nairobi on Business class and it was good. Hence on our way back I decided to upgrade and fly business class, expecting the same. It was the biggest mistake in my life. The so called business class was just close to the premium economy of most other airlines. Seats had some push back and that's it. The leg extender was stuck and won't extend. Cabin crew said they were helpless - they didn't even try to see if it can be worked. I had to spend the entire flight sitting upright cos without the leg extender to support, I was slipping down if I reclined the seat. Horrible experience and to top it all there event wasn't a TV on the 5 hour 20 minute flight. Cabin crew said that this aircraft only has so much facility and they were looking at each other and smiling when they heard that I actually upgraded to business class. I would like to know how I can claim a refund. Where and how can I escalate this matter to. I sent a dm on Twitter to the airline which they haven't responded. Such daylight robbery must not be permitted. This isn't the upgrade we pay for. I am going to share my horrible experience on all social media channels. Interestingly I have not received any survey about my flight experience, which they promptly send. Never flying Kenya Airways again.",6th July 2023
11,"✅ Trip Verified |  One of the worst airlines I travelled on. KQ765 delayed out of JHB with no reason given only left at 02:30 on Sunday morning 25 June in stead of 01:15. Missed our connection flight out of Nairobi to Zanzibar. Ground staff made us wait for 3 hours before we got any assistance in Nairobi. Eventually got a Precision flight to Zanzibar after we had to fight the staff for seats. We were assured that the flight will have our baggage on it as it was scheduled to leave 3 hours after we got our seats. When we arrived in Zanzibar we had no baggage and the ground staff was rude saying it was not their fault we did not have our baggage and that it would be at the Zanzibar airport on Sunday evening with the next flight and if we want it we can come fetch it then. We where on honeymoon and our Hotel is 1 hour 20min away from the airport, as we booked a all inclusive package which included our transfer to and from the hotel, we had no means to get back to the airport to collect our bags. We requested that they please deliver the bags to the hotel. Ground staff said they can only deliver on Monday morning. When we asked for compensation to get some necessities like toothbrush and clean clothes, as we had no clothes or toiletries and had a dinner reservation for Sunday evening, we were told it is not their problem nor their fault our baggage did not arrive and they rushed us out of their office. Needless to say we did not receive our baggage that evening. Monday morning 26 June I phoned the lost baggage office and was told the delivery will only start work at around 10:00 and would need to make a few stops before he gets to us. We ended up getting our baggage at 15:00 Monday afternoon. Missing the whole Sunday and most of Monday of our vacation because of having no clothes.",4th July 2023
12,"✅ Trip Verified |  No where near does this airline come to being called the pride of Africa, it has made us as Kenyans embarrassed. The flight itself delayed for over 4 hours with no valid explanation nor any compensations. No regrets no apologies. The cabin crew are probably the rudest you'll ever come across as if they are doing you a favor. No courtesy and concerns for the three infants and 1 elderly I was traveling with on the contrary we were begging for the very basics and still not provided, like infant food! Inspire of pre-arranged meals non of my infants got the baby meals. The aircraft they are using is not for long distance international flights as the seats are extremely compact and zero legroom. We came out of the flight tired and exhausted as if we had been in war. Ground crew at both the airports equally the same and no sense of responsibility. Check in experience, 1.5 hours just to check in my family of 5 adults and 3 babies. How in the world can you explain this? Cabin smells stale from previous flight and nothing fresh. This is the worst airline I've ever travelled in.",3rd July 2023
13,"Not Verified |  Never use this airline, original flight had a 2 hour layover. It was canceled and the new flight had a 8+ hour layover. Nowhere comfortable to sit as the don't give you access to the Pride Lounge but only a food voucher with no food selection but a set meal. Staff have a terrible attitude and not bothered to help. I will never use this Kenya Airways again.",1st July 2023
14,"Not Verified |  The flight on return journey was excellent. A sumptuous fish menu provided on my return yesterday. Staff are caring and lovely to talk to. I watched a cookery show and learnt a recipe on flight. Also a construction show though took it off half way due to the swearing. There wasn't much to watch for me but I left happy learning a potato recipe from South Africa. A bit of a delay in Nairobi for an hour but as I was on holiday it didn't spoil any plans. I spoke to a lady going to USA and she was given accommodation for missing connecting flight. So not so bad. My issue seems mild but one that all schools are aware of in London. We had a nut snack and I did hope that those with nut allergies where considered. At my children's 3 schools, we simply remove nuts from children packed lunch or school dinners and from view as some people get very bad allergies. Maybe it was the type of nuts served but I was surprised to see nuts on the menu.",30th June 2023
15,"Not Verified | My family of 4 people had booked to fly from Glasgow to Nairobi thru Amsterdam on 26 th June 2023. As they were preparing to fly, they received a message that the flight from Glasgow to Amsterdam is cancelled. Thus the re-booking is done for 2 people on 26 th and the other 2 on 27 th June. That would have messed all our onward plans. As today is a Sunday, we never got any response from the agent in Scotland who booked the tickets. As a last resort, with a prejudiced mind that I am just gambling, I called Kenya Airways number. The response I received was absolutely amazing. We got re-booking from Edinburgh to Amsterdam to reach Nairobi as planned earlier. I am really thankful.",25th June 2023
16,"Not Verified |  I had booked a return flight from Copenhagen to Mombasa and back. Unfortunately I missed my connecting flight going to Mombasa. I booked another flight to Mombasa and I immediately contacted Kenya Airways customer support to find a solution for my return flight. I wrote and called them for a week before I heard back from Kenya Airways. Fortunately the reply was (in writing) that my return ticket was confirmed. When I went to Mombasa airport to fly back they could not find my ticket. I showed them the email with the confirmation and the Kenya Airways lady in Mombasa agreed that it said my ticket was confirmed. Head office refused to let me onboard unless I purchased a new ticket. I did so to come home to my family and I was advised to contact customer service when I got back to get my money back. Then followed several months where I have been writing with Kenya Airways Customer Support. All sort of excuses came up claiming I had the wrong visa, to me being a student and other lies. Finally they concluded that in reality I had not purchased a new ticket, instead I had paid a penalty fee for missing my original flight. I then provided Kenya Airways with a copy of my receipt from Mombasa airport that clearly states that I had to my a new ticket. Since then Kenya Airways have ignored my emails. I am really shocked how Kenya Airways has tried to avoid taking responsibility and done so by lying, bullying and inventing stories to make me drop my claim. I followed every procedure the moment I missed my plane and I truly trusted and believed Kenya Airways when they wrote me that my ticket was confirmed. The lesson learned is apparently that you cannot trust Kenya Airways.",20th June 2023
17,"✅ Trip Verified |  I have been flying with Kenya Airways for the past 6 years, experienced a delay once which was okay but I had the worst experience in May where both trips were a disappointment. First, on the 14th May my Departure was delayed from 6am to 4pm. No apologies nothing, they kept on rescheduling the flight without proper communication. We late boarded Emirates to Nairobi. Again it took us hours to board from Nairobi to Mombasa. I was supposed to arrive at Mombasa 11am on the 14th Sunday but we arrived 2am on the 15th Monday.Worst scenario was on 28th May, my flight was scheduled at 8:45pm to Nairobi then connecting flight at 11.45pm.I arrived on time waited on the queue reaching the counter am told my flight was rescheduled to 7pm! On the screen I could see clearly my flight displayed at 8:45pm.Seriously ! Without even sending a notification, remember while booking phone number and email address is always part of the reservation details. The staff showed no remorse and asked me to check with reservation team. I walked politely to KQ office. I was so shocked when the reservation agent told me that my ticket is not valid ,that it's just a paper - so from changing the time to my ticket being void. This was the worst respond ever! Kenya airways staff lie a lot. He even told me that they tried to send a notification of which he wasn't sure. After insisting for a whole one hour, a supervisor later checked me in and I boarded the 8:45pm flight they booked me a hotel in Nairobi and I had to board my flight at 5pm.I missed my reporting day at work .It was my last time boarding Kenya airways Such a shame.",8th June 2023
18,"✅ Trip Verified |  At a time when many airlines are improving their product, Kenya Airways appears to be going in the opposite direction. Getting onto the aircraft in Nairobi was chaotic with no priority given to business passengers – for the airline ‘Sky Priority’ means nothing. From the boarding gate we then went on a long bus journey around the airport before returning to part of the terminal to climb up stairs to get onto the aircraft. Although the cabin crew were very pleasant and offered a pre-flight drink (champagne, water or apple juice) no more drinks were served until after the meal arrived. This was a total disappointment with my beef option consisting of two small pieces of beef, some sauce and a mini samosa. It was complemented with a glass of wine in a thimble-sized glass which was only refilled when we asked the crew. One of the mysteries of the flight was why the lavatory at the front of the aircraft permanently had an engaged light on. When we asked we were told that the captain had said that it was ‘reserved for the crew and passengers could not use it’. Another mystery was a man who spent the entire flight sat on the crew jumpseat in the middle of the business section. I asked him what he was doing and he explained that the crew ‘could not find me anywhere to sit’. Given that airlines flying into the UK have a legal obligation to provide advance passenger information 24-hours before arrival it would be interesting to know how this requirement was met. Although the aircraft was clean and the flight was smooth, Kenya Airways’ 787 are let down by their old-style side-by-side seating which was worn and, in some cases, not functioning properly. The fact that the flight was full suggests that the airline has no problem selling tickets and therefore little incentive to improve its product.",3rd June 2023
19,✅ Trip Verified |  This is a bad airline. I travelled with Kenya airways on the 20th of May 2023 and now is the 26 May 2023 and l haven't received my bag. I was told the bags were left in Kenya. I have made several phone calls to Zimbabwe and also here l have visited their office in Dubai they are not giving mey bag. This is my last time to travel with Kenya airways.,26th May 2023
20,"✅ Trip Verified |  Missed outward leg of a return flight, due to issue with KA website. Accepted loss here, though honestly feel website more than 50% responsible. Problem was return leg automatically cancelled. Engaged from two weeks before flight with what is inexplicably called 'customer support' and still had to pay again at the last minute to get a flight back to Nairobi. Total loss considerably more than the original return flight total. Sent at least 8 messages to customer support. Initial replies reassuring and seemed to offer resolution, but nothing happened. Reassurances turned out to be misleading and the information I needed was never offered. Customer service agents, while courteous and polite, seem to assume that customers will have an understanding of the rules and practices of the dystopian KA universe. No useful information is provided. It also appears that agents do not have the authority to actually resolve anything. Therefore, they do not really engage with an issue, but dole out meaningless bland reassurances. To get a flight, it required a very long and expensive phone call with an agent who had to constantly refer to a supervisor. Thankfully there are alternatives to KA, both externally and internally.",30th April 2023
21,"✅ Trip Verified |  Very good flight, excellent crew on board, as was the food and drink. My only gripe is the business class seats could do with an update, but they are comfortable none the less.",1st April 2023
22,"✅ Trip Verified |  Kigali - Nairobi - Entebbe return 26-27 March 2023. Aircraft were narrowbodies. The first flight was on a B737, while the three remaining flights were on E190’s. All four (short-haul) flights were on time. This was a Mileage Run to retain my Flying Blue gold status as it otherwise was going to expire by end of the month. I was at first travel attempt denied boarding and my ticket was suspended by a junior staff in Kigali. They said, upon liaising with Immigration I Airport, that my reason to travel was not valid. I tried to change purpose, but the damage was done, which forced me to postpone the entire trip. However, later I had the ticket reissued by KQ town office in Kigali, who were professional and committed to help without any payments as it was not a No Show case. They even took over the booking from my travel agent which was effective and great relief avoiding potential additional costs. I even got a much better (and more expensive) itinerary avoiding night-flights though extending my transit lounge stays. While the junior KQ staff in airport should be sacked for denying me boarding, the KQ staff at town office should be praised and rewarded for constructive and expedite provision of resolutions and quick ticket reissue by ignoring and avoiding the OTA. The rescheduled trip went fine in all aspects. Lounge access accommodated prior to all 4 flights, and the lounges are all of good and solid quality. Slept fine in Pride Lounge in Nairobi where I spent an eve and a night. Effective boardings/deboardings by either bus, on foot, or by jetbridge. Onboard, welcome champagne available on all four flights. I had prebooked seat 1A which was given me throughout. I preordered my favorite seafood meals which were delivered and tasty. The sole exception was a morning flight, where they could not manage my seafood, despite it appeared in their flight manuscript; not a big issue, but they apologised. KQ always manage special meals effectively; this is really a perk that not even legacy carriers like Qatar Airways or KLM allows for. The crews on all flights were fine, professional, caring, and in good mood. The food is getting better on these regional flights, and I had my tasty hot mini-meals served throughout. Hot towels provided. Nut mix were provided as snacks provided to assist on drinks, which were served several times. The challenge of my trip was the seemingly unusual turn-around in EBB to which airport staff were confused as I instantly returned to my origin without going landside. They allowed me not to buy a transit visa, and escorted me to transfer security and thereafter negotiated excessive spending time in lounge for me – I was granted full access for 7 hours though the airline agreement was only 3 hours. Onboard, no IFE and no WiFi which is fine for short flights. No luggage/baggage issues. Flying Blue status respected and some SkyPriority entitlements were given. E.g. priority boarding. Recommended. Will fly them again. Would have given 10/10 but have to deduct a bit for denied boarding initially by the junior, incompetent staff member in Kigali airport.",29th March 2023
23,"✅ Trip Verified |  This review is regarding Kenya Airways customer service and has nothing to do with the details of a specific flight. Our return to Chicago was cancelled when the KA pilots went on strike. My family of four was left to arrange alternate flight arrangements by ourselves and our travel agent who was back in Chicago. We absolutely received no help from anyone at KA. Finally got economy class tickets with Turkish Air which we took from Nairobi to Istanbul and home to Chicago. Had to pay for those tickets and was told to wait for a refund of the return with KA for our cancelled business class tickets. As it turned out, we had to wait a while for our refund which finally arrived on Feb 27. The refund was issued for almost $1200 each ($4800 for the four of us). While this may sound fair, please consider that we paid a total of $14,647 for our four business class round trip tickets to Nairobi and back. Additionally, we had to pay for our return via Turkish Air at a total of $6356. So the refund represented less than 1/3rd of the cost of the original round trip tickets. We were hoping for some consideration of the cost we incurred with Turkish Air, which ultimately was caused by KA. Following a recommendation from the CEO of KA I was contacted by one of his subordinates. While, I do believe that this individual may have had some impact upon the processing of the refund, I disagreed with him on numerous occasions when he and his staff tried to explain the refund policy to me following disruptions in service. The following is a direct quote from his email to regarding these situations: “In the event of disruptions such as the strike, the airline makes arrangements to carry you at the earliest opportunity on one of our scheduled services or reroute you to the destination shown on the ticket by our own services or those of another carrier at no additional cost to you. Should the alternative flights not be suitable or we are unable to rebook you to an alternate flight, you are entitled to a refund of the value of the unused portion of your tickets.” I contended to him that neither myself nor any member of my family was approached by anyone from KA to reroute us OR that anybody at the KA desk was willing to assist us make alternate flight arrangements. I was particularly incensed when I read the words in red, stating “…at no additional cost to you.” I feel lied to and disrespected by Kenya Airways in their addressing our significant and inconvenient disruption of service. I have found examples of other travelers on our flight similarly affected by the strike who had desk clerks reroute them with no additional out of pocket expenditure. The positive feelings I had about Kenya Airways prior to leaving Africa have been replaced by a lack of trust, a vow to never fly KA again, and to pursue informing all travelers I can to be aware and leery of KA’s management of refunds and its ultimate care and respect for passengers.",28th March 2023
24,"✅ Trip Verified | On the Nairobi to Addis Ababa leg of my inbound flight from Dubai to Addis Ababa on March 16, 2023, our flight KQ402 was supposed to depart at 17.00 but finally after a very long and painful waiting we boarded the plane at 23.00pm! Imagine arriving from Dubai at 7.00am and waiting all day long and all night and add to this no cooperative staff and zero services! To add insult to injury, again they did it on the return flight! Apparently, delayed flights are a norm in this airline. Our flight KQ310 on 26 march was delayed by almost 2 hours.

Asking them that they need to send a message for my connection flight that there will a delay, they advised that they will send and email. Upon arriving at OR I was told there is nothing they can do and there was no email sent and they just need to book accommodation and in the morning I will have to come back to the office to meet their manager. They could not assist and had to buy a new flight for the missed connection flight as they did not take responsibility knowing that I missed the connection flight because of their delays.

And this is at the boarding gate after passport control! My partner showed his passport and boarding pass to another representative and was let through with no questions. Some French people were told to go away and come back in 40 minutes, as I was still standing there trying to get Internet working and figuring out how to get my prove of EU settlement status, which I don't need to fly to London anyway if I am EU citizen.

29,✅ Trip Verified |  I flew Kenya Airways to travel to Dubai for a conference on the 4th of December 2022. My luggage was delayed and as such was not available when I landed in Dubai on the 5th December. As such I needed to incur expenses to purchase clothing and undergarments in order to be able to attend the conference. My luggage was returned to me on the 6th of December. I submitted a claim for my expenses to customer care at Kenya Airways on 12 December. I have yet to receive any assistance from the airline to date despite following up multiple times. The only feedback that I have received is receipt of my email and advice that they have escalated my claim. I will NEVER travel Kenya Airways again and would not advise anyone to travel via this airline either.,14th March 2023
30,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had the most horrible flight experience with Kenya Airways and no compensation for delays and lost luggage. My flight from JHB - Lagos on Thursday 1/03/2023 was delayed for nearly 3 hours in Johannesburg. I missed my flight from Nairobi to Lagos. Because I had a flight to catch to Berlin I jumped into Accra flight and from from there paid for Lagos flight.

When asking for full refund, they hold $5000 for 45 days (and still not received) and only offer of refund was with a no show fee deducted, despite being at the airport when making the booking!

32,"✅ Trip Verified |  Boarding and seating was fine. First flight was in what I would call premium economy, whereas the second flight was in, albeit tired, in business class. The food was not very much what I would call “pride of Africa” standard but the attendants were very helpful. I was very concerned when we were sprayed with a very noxious smelling substance - 8 canisters held by two attendants. Without any prior warning or consultation. The contents of these canisters was not revealed to me even though i asked. I am on day 7 of feeling very ill with breathing trouble and eyesight and diarrhoea. I attribute this to the 3 episodes of being sprayed - once on the first flight, then again while stationery at Victoria falls by crew with big spray containers and hand sprays as you would do in a field (or should not do). Then again after departure from Nairobi. The food was mediocre to poor. I’d hate to think what the economy class food was like if this was business class. My seat in the first plane could not recline and the seat in the second one struggled to go up or down. Well I certainly would like to know what we were sprayed with and how we were not informed thereof.",25th February 2023

36,✅ Trip Verified |  They misplaced my bag. I filled a form at Heathrow airport and that was it. I waited for days for calls nothing until I finally found their UK line and i called them and they kept telling me to hold on. Eventually they sent a bag but it was another person’s bag. I called that my should be brought and the other be returned. I told them I wouldn’t release the bag until my bag is sent and i am not comfortable with having someone’s property with me. Then i was told the true owner of the bag is in Dubai and my bag is with them at Nairobi and a “picture” of a wrapped bag (I didn’t wrap my bag) was sent. Another 2 weeks and nothing has been done again. Customer service is totally rude this time. Kept complaining to them that all my clothes are in that bag and I have no winter cloth to wear here but they aren’t even ready to help,12th February 2023
37,"✅ Trip Verified |  Horrible first time experience. Travelled from London on 19th January to Nairobi transiting to Ghana. Before that they changed our departure time from Nairobi to 30mins late. As if that was not enough, we got to Nairobi at about 9pm after being delayed at Heathrow only to be told our flight had been delayed again for another 6hours. Instead of leaving at 10pm, we were to leave at 4am. No communication, and not even a rep to speak to another airport in Nairobi, which is their headquarters. No body cared about us and all a lady could say it, we will give you hot food. Such a horrible experience, to just sit at the airport for 6hours, after an 8and half hour flight with no place to freshen up, and then instead of leaving at 4, we left at 4.50am. No apologies from anyone. Now I am dreading my return journey. I will not take this airline again and will certainly not recommend to any one. Shame to treat other Africans as 2nd class citizens and yet call yourself the pride of Africa. Maybe it’s time to change that name not befitting your poor services.",21st January 2023
38,✅ Trip Verified |  I wanted to change my one flight time and was advised that i would be charged 2400USD. 2400USD for a change that was more almost double of what it cost me to fly from USA and then to South Africa. I was only requesting a flight time change from Kenya to South Africa. I tried to call customer services a few times and it takes almost an hour for them to answer. After waiting an hour they cut me off. All said i would never recommend this airline to anyone. ,14th January 2023
39,"Not Verified |  Highly do not recommend. Flight on the way to London had no working screens. On my connecting flight to Johannesburg, they overbooked our flight by 70 passengers. No order or sympathy whatsoever and it was a dog fight to get the first available seat which was 8 hours later ! Will never fly with them again.",9th January 2023
40,"✅ Trip Verified |  We were travelling from Amsterdam to Johannesburg with Kenia Airways. Our original itinerary was as follows. Amsterdam to Paris KQ1243 05/01/2023 16:35 > 17:50 Paris to Nairobi KQ115 05/01/2023 20:20 > 06:25 Nairobi to Johannesburg KQ760 06/01/2023 07:45 > 10:55 When boarding in Paris we were made to sit in the aeroplane for 4.5 hours without air conditioner, food, or drink. We eventually left and arrived too late for our connecting flight to Johannesburg. Kenia Airways wasn’t prepared at all for this eventuality even though they knew about it for more than 12 hours. We were bundled into a group, and they tried sorting out the passengers rerouted flight. This took Kenia Airways 4 hours to complete for us, some passengers were still waiting after us. Our Itinerary changed to: Nairobi to Dar Es Salaam KQ488 06/01/2023 23:45 > 01:15 Dar Es Salaam to Johannesburg 4Z37 07/01/2023 03:25 > 06:10 On arrival at Johannesburg, we realized that our luggage wasn’t on the carousel. Even after I did confirm with Kenia Airways 4 times that the luggage would be rerouted with our itinerary change. Once when we received our changed flight details. Second time just before we were taken to the hotel to freshen up. Third time on my return from the hotel and then the last time when boarding the flight to Dar Es Salaam. I was reassured that our luggage would be on the flight with us each time. Now getting to realize that the above was all lies just to get rid of me, we started the process to find our luggage. After being sent to 3 different counters we were directed to the Airlink Customer Service Centre. Here we met our angel who checked and assured us that the luggage never arrived in Dar Es Salaam which means that Airlink didn’t receive it from Kenia Airways. This meant it wasn’t Airlinks responsibility anymore, but they then told us that they will load an enquiry and get the process going. Upon loading, he realized that the luggage was still in Nairobi but was scheduled to be on Flight KQ760 on 7/1/2023. This meant that Kenya Airways didn’t change the luggage tags to include our flights. The problem was that now we were already on the landside of the airport and couldn’t go back to the airside to get our luggage on the carousel after the flight land at 10:55.",9th January 2023
41,"✅ Trip Verified | On 29.11.2022 I tried to make a booking online for a ticket costing 930 USD for a relative however the kenya airways website showed error after the payment and the ticket was not issued. I bought the same ticket the same day from another bank account. On 30.11.2022 I contacted the KA customer service to cancel the booking in process (for the 1st ticket), the agent promised to do that instead he issued the ticket. He apologized and promised I would receive refund within 5 days, instead the 5th day the money was taken from my account (it was in authorisation status until). I placed a refund claim online which was acknowledged by KA and I was promised to be paid within 15 working days which did not happen. I tried to communicate with KA, however I either received no response or very general responses. I don't see any good will from KA to reimburse the money which was taken from my account because of the fault of their agent. Their whatsapp customer service is a joke, if you manage to speak to actual person the minute you mention refund they cut you off. Don't fly with this airline. I really regret giving KA a 2nd chance.",27th December 2022
42,Not Verified |  I booked my business class seat with Kenyan Airways on Thursday the 3rd of November for Sunday the 6th. I had a BA flight booked for the 7th but needed to be home early. At no time at booking was any issues indicated. I had to fly to Nairobi the day before and stay in the Crowne Plaza near the airport for the night. At 6:30 am I arrived at the terminal to find utter chaos. It transpires the pilots had gone on strike a day or so previously. At no point was there any communication to tell passengers this. We were pushed from pillar to post around the airport and then told to stand in line to rebook. There were still people waiting from the previous day to get alternative flights. Fortunately I’m in the position to be able to afford to find an alternative so got a business seat from Nairobi to Dubai on Emirates and then a 6 hour layover and then onto Heathrow again with Emirates. It’s now been over a month and despite putting in my claim I’m still waiting for my £2600 one way ticket to be refunded. I’ve given them the benefit of the doubt for a month and absolutely nothing hence my review. They clearly are going to hang onto my money for as long as possible and ignore me. I’m going back to Kenya soon and have stuck with BA I would never trust Kenyan Airways again.,13th December 2022
43,✅ Trip Verified |  First time in Kenya Airways and all was good. They had an email upgrade offer to either business class or to have the seat next to you vacant. I chose the latter as it was only $45 and an hour ten flight. Check in was friendly and easy. Zanzibar airport has a new terminal but there is literally one restaurant and one shop. Nothing else so was stuck with all my Taz currency as there was nothing to buy. Boarding was quick. FA greeting at the door. Had my seat next to me open as promised so lots of space. Smooth take off and drink and snack service for the flight. No inflight entertainment but for a short flight who cares. Landed early and bags off once we were thru immigration. Great flight.,12th December 2022
44,"Not Verified | We booked our tickets to Zanzibar on 10 July 22 already! We chose a direct flight route and paid the premium for that choice. 8 hours before our departure Kenya Airways sends a message to say that our connection flight to Zanzibar has been delayed. On further investigation we found that Kenya Air has now charged us the expensive direct route, but placed us on the delayed cheap route just prior to departure. We are losing a fully paid day at our hotel in Zanzibar, and have to sit on Nairobi airport from 07h20 to 19h50. Great way to start our honeymoon! We have been trying to resolve this issue for 3 hours but they do not even bother to communicate to their passengers. This airline is a total scam!!!",11th December 2022

Since then, I’ve had several back and forth to their office and until today November 14, they have not issued my refund. Every time I talk to them, it’s the same false promises! This airline has no accountability, especially when dealing with foreigners. Once they have your money in their country, it’s gone! I’d not recommend anyone to trust these thieves.",14th November 2022
46,Not Verified |  I was connecting from Lusaka to New York from Kenya I got off the plane I checked the board it said gate 16 for JFK New York so I sat there waiting for the boarding call . The flight for New York was supposed to departure at 11:35 I sat there for almost an hour with no boarding call. I asked one of the employees there what time the flight for New York was leaving she gave a vague answer than around 11:40 or so they was a last boarding call. The Gate was charged to gate 19 I almost missed my flight and than I had to run to the Gate. I had a very bad experience and I don't think I will fly Kenya Airways again very disappointed.,24th October 2022
47,"✅ Trip Verified |  The flight service started well with staff being warm and interactive. Aisha warmly smiled and engaged the people around me. She has great customer service and deserved a recognition. I was having red wine and when she did not have any when I asked for it once she found the wine she brought it for me and warmly said that ""I found your preference"" The food was not so great and the flight felt congested however the service compensated for some not so good things. Hopefully this message of appreciation will reach her (Aisha) and her colleague Dams. To be honest as well that Kenya Airways is probably the only airline that offers one of the best luggage allowance making it a top choice while travelling home.",3rd October 2022
48,"Not Verified | We have just flown into Nairobi from Harare and going on to Amsterdam and Heathrow. Things started badly - the flight was delayed for an hour and a half, no explanation or apology offered. On board we then noticed there was no in flight entertainment on offer. Neither of us had flown long distance before on a plane without in flight entertainment. There were no blankets on offer either. It can get pretty cool on these flights. The food was a joke. Something like a mini pasty with quite a nasty taste and, possibly even worse, a savoury muffin! We're only half way through this flight (in Nairobi). We're now waiting for 8 hours overnight. The 'restaurant' we're in is quite possibly the saddest looking place I've ever drunk a coffee in. Unloved doesn't begin to describe it. Anyway we're wondering now, can this possibly get any worse. There are certain words which are applicable here but this will not be published if I include them but I'm sure you can guess what they are. What's really alarming is looking back at reviews from 11years ago making exactly the same criticisms.",2nd October 2022
49,✅ Trip Verified |  The cabin crew were very rude. Food was  almost thrown at us. When I asked for beverage she said she didn't have and no alternative was offered until I peeped and saw what I asked. The crew was not courteous at all.,22nd September 2022
50,✅ Trip Verified |  Due to flight delay I have to stay airport long time. Firstly in Antananarivo to Nairobi there was 1h flight delay. Real time was 7pm and in Nairobi they said flight will fly at 8pm but again it delayed - it fly after 11pm. This is a worst experience that I had in my life. because of his I have to stay on bench 24h without food and sleep.,14th September 2022
51,"Not Verified |  Paid a fortune to return to Kenya on short notice. I have used KQ many times and always flown business, not used them for a few years now due to covid and using other airlines. Check in at Heathrow and boarding the plane was a shambles. stood in a business class line, but no one checking in Business class passengers , despite being told by ground staff this was the correct lane. Eventually we were spotted and check became proactive after 20 minutes. similar issue trying to get on the planE. KQ is let down by the ground handling at Heathrow. Once on Board, the service is excellent with attentive staff and I like the Boeing 787. Quality of the Beverages is good and has clearly improved. The quality of the food is poor and not what would get on SWISS, etc. In contrast on the return journey at Nairobi, excellent and quick check in, security and lounge has improved form when used in the past Food on the return leg just as bad as on the way out. Once again the staff were excellent and attentive and very helpful. Entertainment, pretty poor and lacking in choice.",1st September 2022

Before leaving the airport on arrival I placed a complain with Dnata baggage services regarding my baggage and I was assured that I would get my luggage in less than 48 hours which have turn into two weeks have finished every penny I had on me for mobile top up and when I even call no 1 picks no get back to me, have sent emails and gotten no reply.

56,Not Verified |  I have never seen such an ill-functioning airline. The airline people took 1 hour to check my documentation and after issuing my boarding pass they informed that the flight is delayed by 3 hours which left me no choice but to stay at the airport for more than 5 hours. The airline was least bothered with the inconvenience and didn’t do anything to compensate this. I will strongly suggest never fly with them.,10th July 2022
57,"✅ Trip Verified |  I have never flown on such an inconsiderate airline. I am appalled by the service. The flight from Paris to Nairobi was delayed, which meant I missed my connecting flights to Johannesburg then to Cape Town. This did not seem to worry them and they said it would be at my expense to rebook another flight to Cape Town. This is the fourth time I’ve flown Nairobi airways and all four times they were late and caused subsequent missing of flights. This airline should be shut down! They treat people with absolute disrespect!",9th July 2022
58,"✅ Trip Verified | This is the worst airline I have ever flown. We booked roundtrip direct flights to Mauritius to and from Nairobi for our honeymoon. We planned to spend 7 days in Mauritius. The night before our flight from Nairobi to Mauritius, I was emailed (yes, emailed) at 11.19pm while I was sleeping to inform me that our flight time was to be changed from 1.00pm to 7.30am. As I was understandably sleeping at the time, I did not review this message until I woke up at 5.30am that morning. I was staying in Naivasha, Kenya at the time and so did not have time to make it to the airport. We immediately called due to the fact that we were going to miss our flight and no one was able to explain to us why this change was made so last minute to the flight schedule and why we were not informed ahead of time. I would think it would be common sense that an email in the middle of the night 8 hours prior to the new proposed flight time (for a now 7.30am flight) is insufficient notice. Even after speaking to multiple different Kenya Airways employees, I was never given a reason for the flight time change (just ""operations""). Ultimately we were rebooked for a flight late that day, but this was an indirect flight through Dubai, which didn't leave until 5.10pm and involved >16 hours of travel instead of what was supposed to be a 4 hour and 20 minute flight. Because of this, we were unable to check in for our hotel that we had paid for the night of our arrival and instead arrived the next morning, exhausted, having been traveling all night and transferring in Dubai in the middle of the night. To boot, the behaviour of the passengers on the plane from Nairobi to Dubai was absurd. People were constantly standing up on the plane and blocking the aisle even after being asked to sit down by flight attendants. Kids were running around unrestrained and flight attendants had to ask over the intercom for parents to restrain their children multiple times. In the row in front of me someone was watching a movie on a tablet with nonstop gunfire with the volume on max and he was not using headphones. To top it all off, in addition to missing our first night of the trip, Kenya Airways also changed our return flight time, moving it up from 7.10pm to 1.40pm. This effectively compromised two different days of our trip (as we were unable to do much the morning of our departure and were unable to take advantage of the late checkout that we were qualified for at our hotel). On top of it all, our return flight was ultimately delayed by 40 minutes and the process to check in our bags took an absurdly long time, longer than it has ever taken for any other flight I have been on. We had all of our documents and it still took us >10 minutes to complete the check in process and this was after standing in line for one hour waiting for the check in desk. Bottom line, if you can avoid it, do not fly on Kenya Airways. You will absolutely regret it. We contacted customer service multiple times and they have absolutely refused to make amends or compensate us in any way for destroying our honeymoon.",1st July 2022
59,"✅ Trip Verified |  Worst airline I have ever flown, customer service is the worst. Their agent are rude and mean, not helpful at all. Do not fly this airline, especially via Nairobi. Food is terrible, seats are nearly broken in the aircraft",19th June 2022
60,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flying from Lusaka to London via Nairobi last month with Kenya Airways was a shocking experience. Pre-departure tests are no longer needed upon arrival to England. However, my instinct told me to check if I needed a PCR to transit through Kenya. The COVID information on the Kenya Airways website is extremely misleading. When I filled in all the details about my trip, it said nothing about a PCR test; however, when I spoke to an agent on WhatsApp they said I need a PCR test as I am not vaccinated (screenshots attached). Having to rush around Lusaka the day before I flew to London, I eventually got a PCR test. I arrived at Lusaka Airport at 23:30 on Sunday and did not get my bags checked in until 01:10 on Monday (5 minutes before baggage drop off closes) due to the airline and staff's poor customs. I knew my bags were overweight and decided to pay the additional cost rather than repack. I was told that I cannot pay using card and can only pay in Kwacha or US Dollar. I had £100, which was roughly the additional cost and it took over 45 minutes for the staff to find out whether I could pay using British Pounds and inform me. The ATM I was advised to go to outside on the bottom floor of the airport was out of service and I had to run to the domestic airport (10 minutes from the international airport if you're in shape) to withdraw cash from the second nearest ATM. The total amount was 2066 Kwacha and when I presented 2100 Kwacha, I was told they did not have any change... If you are travelling to Southern Africa, Ethiopian Airlines is a much better airline and I can see why more people prefer them over Kenya Airways.",18th June 2022
61,"✅ Trip Verified |  Checked in online the evening before the flight. Aircraft depicted was a 737-800. I selected and paid for an exit row seat. A couple of hours later, I received a text message saying that the flight was going to be delayed from 0745 to 1120 for the usual ‘operational reasons’. On arrival at the airport the next morning for the delayed departure, I was issued with a boarding pass that still showed my original seat number of 19A. As it turned out, the airline had changed the aircraft to an Embraer 190 (which I discovered when we were boarding), so while I had the same seat number from the original 737, it was not in an exit row on the E190. No apology, no information at check in. Boarding was chaotic as usual. They called for Business Class and Priority passengers to board first (I have Siver Elite status), only for everybody to end up on a bus that waited until it was full before proceeding to the airplane. So much for priority boarding. Even with the delayed departure time, the flight was delayed even further, departing at 1220. KQ is a disgrace. Unfortunately, they are currently the only airline serving the Nairobi-Johannesburg route and are milking this for all it’s worth with shoddy service. Pride of Africa? Not by a long shot!",14th June 2022
62,"✅ Trip Verified | Monrovia to Kigali through Accra and Nairobi 19-20 May 2022. The 2 aircrafts were both B737-800s in very good condition. I had to change my departure dates and it took me only 10 minutes online - and was even free as it was a “Business Light” ticket. All flights were on time. Checked in online. Monrovia Airport is full of hustlers pretending to be from the airline but want tips and they are annoying, the airline should chase them away. Kenya Airways (KQ) uses a third party lounge in Monrovia which is small but good with courteous, proactive attendants. No champagne, but plenty of drinks and liquor. The local Club beer is good. Embarking easy, fast, not a single crosscheck from lounge to seat – what a pleasure. Onboard, welcome drinks were served. The seats were huge and well bolstered, reclining, new, and very comfortable. Could sleep. IFE or WiFi was only working on the last leg. No printed menus were given out, but the FAs asked each individual on food choices. My pre-ordered special sea food meals were all different, delicious, and served without reminders. Business Class was full after Accra, but I did neither feel cramped nor stuffy. FAs, all Kenyans, were good and caring – though maybe not world class. In NBO the Pride lounge did the job for me during the 12 hours’ layover. The last stretch to Kigali was with IFE onboard, champagne, and my beloved seafood hot meal, which KQ still offers (even in economy) in contrast to Qatar and Emirates who have stopped this service at is it not qualifying as “dietary reasons” to order. Luggage delivered quickly and in good order. Good value for money – will fly with them again.",20th May 2022
63,"✅ Trip Verified |  It was a bad experience. I had a flight from Entebbe to Nairobi and from Nairobi to Amsterdam. I missed the first one and went straight to Nairobi. Seemed that they canceled the whole flight. I had to go to sales and they, without explaining any detail, told me I had to pay 475 dollars for a new flight! As I had no time at all I had to make a quick decision but after I tried to ask for answers but I did not get any good explanation beside that I had to pay the difference.

64,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew Kigali to Monrovia over Nairobi and Accra on 8-9 May 2022. Flights on time. Checked in online worked well and got my BPs in airport swiftly. No luggage issues. Recognised as Skyteam elite. Kenya Airways staff came to me in lounge and, without request, carried my hand-luggage for me from lounge to the aircraft. No waiting time nor queues anywhere on the trip despite the flights were full or almost full. KQ delivers and have rarely let me down over the years. Pearl Lounge in Kigali delivers but suffers from deprived views of airport runways. First flight was on an Embraer 190 which is a lovely, roomy aircraft. Onboard, they allowed me to shift to an exit row as my original seat was mistakenly occupied by another person. The seat now offered was very nice - it would have cost me 50 USD if booked online. Drinks were generously provided. Appreciate Kenya Airways often have the Happy Hour concept where a request for a single drink most often triggers serving two. The wine in mini-bottles was acceptable, a South African “Stonedale”. I had requested seafood meal and I got it: it was a cold, tasty salmon sandwich. FAs were kind and effective. No IFE nor WiFi but on a 90 minutes flight its not an issue. Transit in Nairobi Airport smooth and quick. It took me only 15 Minutes to reach the KQ Pride Lounge. I love this lounge, roomy and curvy designs with lots of nice sections. Had a god nights’ sleep after acquainting myself with a Niederburg rose-wine which superseded an alternative, Italian sparkling wine The next flights from Nairobi to Monrovia via Accra were on their B737-800. Despite the flight was completely full (all seats taken in both classes!) the staff manage to care passengers well. No power outlet nor monitors, only WiFi and use of personal devices were possible. Special meal rendered to perfection. I also tried other dishes as I was offered. Drinks provided generously, again Happy Hour (order 1 get 2) occurred at least once. Slight delay as the stop-over in Accra took longer time as a lot of passengers disembarked before cleaning and loads of new passengers came on board – again the flight was full. Luggage in Monrovia came out quickly. Nicely done, Kenya Airways. Can recommend.",10th May 2022
65,"Not Verified | Addis Ababa to Mumbai via Nairobi. Both the mentioned flights delayed in their boarding, moving and landing. The second journey took 8 hours instead of 6.5 hours.

Based on this I had booked a domestic flight from Chennai to Mumbai 6pm 26th April 2022. I had taken the RTPCR test for flying. 6pm web check-in was supposed to be done for Kenya Airways. 4pm i received a message that the flight is rescheduled. The rescheduling was done inappropriately.

I had booked through goibibo. I could not connect with any human being in gooibibo to arrange for alternate ways. So I had to cancel my domestic flight to Mumbai. I cancelled all the Kenya bookings and flew through flydubai with new cost. Still, now the refund has not been given by Kenya Airways or goibibo.

KQ lots my luggage for the second time in a year - this time, bags were not loaded in Lilongwe - and the whole process to get them was just so bad and KQ staff not helpful at all. At the airport, no customer care at all, it took ages (more than two hours) to enter everyone's declaration in the system, then KQ said we would get our bags within 24 hours, which did not happen - it took more than 48 hours to get them. We are supposed to be able to get a refund when the time exceeds 24 hours and guess what? To do so you have to go to the airport, it is not possible to get that online - in Nairobi the airport is 1h away from the city center. Just a way for people to not get it!

Two days later and having not received an email confirmation, I phoned back and they said that the agent I spoke to did not book and I would need to pay £89 dollars as the rates have gone up, pushed to fly on a different date and still there would be a 60 dollar penalty attached. Had the agent booked me in the first time I phoned, I would not be incurring these costs. It took me two days of spending at least 4 hours on the phone to their international number where they are cautious not to phone you back as it will cost them and will happily put you on hold for as long as they want. First day I spoke to an agent who said that they would book me into the flight but refer me to the manager to take off incurred costs, next referred to the supervisor who swore to sort this out asap, waited till end of the day and phoned back and she was about to leave the office but said she has handed over to the next shift manager, nothing happened. Phoned again the following morning and got hold of an agent who also promised to phone me back within an hour, after three hours of waiting, I phoned her back and she put me on hold to go speak to her manager and came back and said that they have reached a decision that I need to pay. Bear in mind that I have had to move this flight twice due to their incompetence.

I booked a flight to Nairobi with departing time 15.20pm only to be rescheduled to a 4 hours later flight at 19.30 and that without notification. I booked the earlier flight because I was connecting later that evening to a Lufthansa flight to Frankfurt. Due to this reschedule, I almost missed my flight to Frankfurt. It only needed friendly Lufthansa staff to open up the gate for me. Kenya Airways staff simply assume that all passengers flying from Kisumu have Nairobi as their final destination. They don’t even think that some might have connection to other countries. I will never fly them again and never recommend them to anyone. They caused me a lot of stress without compensation.",2nd March 2022
71,✅ Trip Verified |  The most horrible customer experience i have ever had with an airline. I have ended up being charged triple the original price I paid despite the fact that I called the customer contact center day before flight. Issued with last minute information to rebook my flight 1.5 hours before the flight. I don't think I have anything nice to say about my experience. Don't think I can recommend the airline to another. Airport staff very unhelpful and dismissive. And don't think I will ever consider to use the airline ever again.,2nd March 2022
72,"✅ Trip Verified |  It's hard for me to write a review because I am not sure if the airline always cancels flights, or if it is just problematic to leave from Sudan. My flight was suddenly canceled twice. One of the times it was canceled was right before departure, after I already took and paid for my covid test. It was incredibly stressful. I wrote to an assistant on whatsapp, who told me it was a computer error and that my flight will still go and that I should just go to the airport. But I felt it was not this way - I called. Thankfully someone helped me and put me on a flight with Ethiopian airlines and I flew with them via Ethiopia. So in the end i never flew with Kenya Airways. It was an incredibly stressful experience, and dealing with people over the phone was impossible. In the end, the woman I spoke to was the only helpful person - and putting me on a new flight with another airline helped a lot. From what I read, they cancel often. If it wasn't for this woman at the end, I would give them a very low rating.",22nd February 2022
73,"✅ Trip Verified |  Arrived at the JKIA an hour before the flight 3 tickets and had excess weight of 3kgs with an option of 6pcs of luggage but had 5. The lady insisted we pay or repack and stated we had no time. Tried to talk to her even her colleague but she refused saying you should have come earlier, any way we did re pack. She insisted we print the PCR test result and I told her we do it digital due to the current covid situation and also we are residents at our destination and had a system in place for that but still insisted we print and time was not on our side. It took me 20 min to do so and when i was back she told me I was late and the gate was already closed. Some efforts were made and we made it to the flight which was empty. Upon arrival in Dubai no luggage. The tickets I had were for 90kgs x3=270 but for sure i had less than the 270kgs with an excess of 3kgs in one pc and no time almost missed my flight. No leniency or situational exceptions, felt really disappointed and couldn't mind the hassle if there was time.  I am not giving up on KQ. Staff pls try to accommodate based on situations.",22nd February 2022

We reached Nairobi to find out that our flight has been delayed to 2pm without any notification. When we argued about the 8 hour plus delay, they offered us a croissant and tea. After spending 8 hours, they further delayed the flight to 4pm without any notification. When argued again they called the manager and the manager didn’t do anything except tell us it’s a technical issue. The truth was that they didn’t have enough passengers so they decided to cancel the flight.",8th December 2021

How come this Kenya airways crew could let me take the flight from Zambia to Harare to Kenya but did not let me take the flight from Kenya to Mauritius and my final destination of this flight was Mauritius, this is unacceptable.

76,"✅ Trip Verified | Wonderful service onboard this early morning flight to Lusaka. Really enjoyed spending time in the new Pride Lounge (which is in another league in terms of ambience compared to the Simba Lounge - although I imagine the former could get quite busy), and appreciated the hassle free check-in and immigration process (although the Covid test check outside in the booth is quite strange). The only negative was the chaotic boarding processes, with no Premier World priority and a free for all to get final verification checks completed. Once onboard, treated to fabulous service from the purser who just couldn't do enough - from offering both business class breakfast options due to a quiet Premier World cabin. The warm fresh croissants and coffee were highlights. I bid to upgrade the ticket which cost $210 but it was really worth the splurge to arrive well refreshed for a day at work. Well done KQ.",9th November 2021
77,"✅ Trip Verified | Hugely enjoyed this trip with KQ. Wonderful to see KQ finally reinstate a full meal service on this route - I spoke to the purser who confirmed so many customers were on connecting flights that the company opted to stop the pathetic small ""pie"" - although I'm told on the early morning flight it is still a cold croissant and tiny piece of fruit, however on this leg a very impressive three hot meal options wee offered - I was the last seat on the last row at the back and they still had all 3 options available - and the traditional East African beef pilau was absolutely delicious. Cabin crew wonderfully interactive - and as always - cannot give you enough drinks - two bottles of wine and two lagers each time. One disappointment was the refusal of Lusaka KQ agents to allow me to use my Flying Blue miles to upgrade at the airport despite being assured by KQ HQ that it is was totally possible. I was told I would only get a bar service as they don't cater for additional unknown business class passengers, but my return trip just didn't bear this out. I don't think they wanted the hassle of a little extra work to be honest! Keep it up KQ, your flights are expensive for the flight duration, but customers also opt for convenience and service and you have this hands-down.",9th November 2021
78,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had an issue with my Covid test (did it too early so it would have expired by the time I got to Ghana). The whole situation was such a mess, I was certain that I would not be able to fly. Lydia advised me that there was a quick testing station outside (which obviously required me to pay an arm and a leg because these Covid test fees are a scam. I digress). She waited for me until the last minute to get my results so she could get my bag checked-in. When I was running between the testing station and the check-in counter, she decided that I could leave my bag there (I was literally the only remaining customer, so she was just being kind) and took my number so I could run downstairs to go check on my results and she could call me once it was absolutely necessary for them to close the counter. She did call me, and while I was running a few minutes late, she spoke to her superiors who agreed that the time was negligible and I could therefore run back upstairs with my results while she waited to quickly send my bag through. Lydia was probably the most helpful airport person I'd ever met. While some of her colleagues were annoyed with my situation and essentially had given up on me, she endeavoured to help me well beyond her call of duty. This is the kind of South Africa I know - one filled with ubuntu, while acting within the confines of professional conduct. Lydia didn't break any rules or try to cut be some slack because that would have been unethical and against her professional conduct. She was both kind and professional. We need more Lydia's at the airport!!!",20th September 2021
79,"✅ Trip Verified |  I never thought I would experience the worst customer care from an airline which boast itself as “the Pride of Africa”. Trouble started during COVID-19 test verification at the check in desk. My family of six (2 adults and 4 kids) were supposed to travel to JFK via London on 24/8/21. Three of my kids had negative test results while the rest of us had turned positive earlier in the month but had been cleared by a health official to end the mandatory isolation on 13/8/21. As required by CDC, in order to travel to the US, a passenger needs to have either a negative test result or proof of recovery (positive test certificate and a discharge letter from a health official) if they were COVID positive within the last 90 days. We presented our fully compliant documents to the check in clerk, but instead of taking their time to confirm that indeed those were the documents that were required at our final destination, she automatically rejected them and said we all had to have negative test results, otherwise we would have to go back and wait until we all tested negative! They didn’t have any reference sheet or document to base their decision on, the only reference was to pretend that they had called an office “who deals with this sort of thing” to confirm. Then enter a “supervisor “ who didn’t even take time to understand what the problem was and said without a care in the world right to our faces “oh, we deal with this sort of thing every single day. We send people home “. They never realized the agony we were going through. Never at any point did they produced any document to support their decision, in fact at one point the “supervisor “ disappeared to go retrieve an internal document that supposedly has the latest updates but returned 10 minutes later empty handed. They absolutely had no clue about what they were saying and could not even take a moment to check the requirements for our country of destination and the CDC website. What a total customer care failure and a huge embarrassment to the company! To say we were deeply disappointed is an understatement. It is a fact once one has tested COVID positive, it is not advisable to retest until after at least 90 days because chances are high that they can still test positive even though they are not contagious. This fact doesn’t seem to make sense to KQ check in clerks, or at least the two I was dealing with. The whole experience caused a lot of emotional distress especially to my kids not to mention financial loss and delay to get back to work. ",26th August 2021
80,"✅ Trip Verified |  It's our first time booking an all round trip with Kenya Airways, our journey to Nairobi and Johannesburg was outstanding, we thought that was all until we experienced a hospitality at its very best when we were returning from Johannesburg to Nairobi and Nairobi to Lagos. Kudos to the pilots in KQ766, very professional in dealings with turbulent, as a flight simulator gamer, I could feel the way the plane was calmed. We connected to KQ532 to Lagos at past 8am on the 12th of June, the hospitality gestures given by the air hostesses was superb and second to none. It is very usual for air hostesses to see and treat you as guests but it's unusual to see them treat to as family. We felt welcomed like home away from home. Bevlyne, one of the hostesses in KQ532, very friendly, calm, jovial and quick to response to passengers request. These trips is unforgettable and forever worthwhile. Will love to travel via Kenya Airways again and again, truly it's the pride of Africa.",20th June 2021
81,"✅ Trip Verified | I think the worst airline I have ever travelled. Do not use them unless you have to. Business class is the worst I have flown - uncomfortable seats, poor quality food and the worst entertainment I have seen on an airline. To cap it all they have lost my baggage which is where they unravel even further with customer service that is completely non-existent. They don't answer the phone, don't respond to emails and their online chat means waiting for 30 minutes and then realising that they actually have no one there at any time of day. It's a novel way of taking responsibility for their failings - just don't answer. I cannot understand how Sky Team can associate with this airline. I will not fly with them again and nor will anyone in my business. ",10th April 2021
82,"✅ Trip Verified | Business passengers went on last because the economy passengers would have walked past two business rows. This was, obviously, for covid-19 reasons but given that every passenger had had a negative PCR test it seemed a little pointless. There was a noticeable degree of irritation among those who had been made to wait until last especially as it is branded ‘Sky Priority’. The seats seemed slightly worn and although the dimmable windows are a nice touch in the 787 they are not as effective as pull-down blinds. We were offered soft drinks before take-off but they produced a glass of champagne when I asked. Breakfast was served before the lights went out. For the main meal the choice was beef, chicken or vegetarian. The cabin crew were polite and efficient although with so much protective equipment it felt more like being in an operating theatre rather than a plane. The food seemed bland and uninspiring. There were no major issues with this flight but if Kenya Airways wants to attract premium passengers post-covid it needs to offer a better and more memorable service.",28th March 2021
83,"✅ Trip Verified | This was not my first time flying business with Kenya Airways but it was definitely not the best. The Plaza lounge at LHR was not serving alcohol on the basis that the food was not ‘substantial’. Boarding was chaotic – although there was a business line everyone was using it. After eventually getting on the aircraft, and after a long wait, I was offered a small glass of champagne. Seating was old-style parallel pair, business was about half full and there were signs of ageing. It then took an inordinate amount of time for the meal to be served – choice was “meat or chicken”. It was probably the first time ever that the starter and main course were both rice. The flight was uneventful and although not fully flat-bed I did manage to sleep. No bottle of water was provided. Breakfast was a small dry croissant, yogurt and a small bowl of fruit. I know airlines are struggling but given how much I paid for the ticket to have a service which was not as good as premium economy on some other airlines was frustrating. If Kenya Airways wants to compete with its rivals it needs to stop penny-pinching and offer its business customers a level of service which justifies what they have paid.",21st March 2021

When we asked for compensation, they offered us a 150 USD travel voucher even if we told them that we won't be able to travel in the next two years.

Our trip is expected to be this April (2021), and we had supposedly received our cancelled flights in the form of a refunded 'voucher' which was never ever received from the airline. We then received (on Christmas Eve) a link to our supposedly 'new flights' which had a time frame to a payment portal from 15h00-17h30/18h00 roughly... let me reiterate, on Christmas Eve, who is checking their emails to rebook flights in such a short time frame? We then tried to access the portal that night at 19h00 and we could not access it to pay an additional fee (when this was supposed to be fully refunded I might add) for our flights in April. I have sent roughly 50 emails to the airline, and that doesn't include my partners emails to Kenya Airways. We have heard nothing back from them, and they have about R35 000 of our money in promised refunded tickets which we do not have and cannot get hold of anybody from Kenya Airways.

88,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flight KQ101 to Johannesburg via Nairobi was meant to depart LHR on 8th February. Flight was at the gate, but boarding time kept getting delayed and delayed and was eventually canceled. Then complete chaos ensued. Kenya Airways do not have a desk at LHR. Tried to call 020 8283 1818 several times on the 8/2 and 9/2 but no answer and then line was disconnected. Was directed to hotel at LHR and then told flight was going to leave, turned out it wasn't so was directed back to hotel. At no point as there any customer service offered to customers. Kenya Airways made no attempt to rebook me on another flight or contact me at all. So had to purchase an alternative flight with SAA at considerable cost as I needed to leave that night.

I checked back on their website a week later and they had dropped the price of change of the ticket to double rather than triple, I contacted them as they intentionally removed the option to change my ticket online, they said they had sent a payment link - well payment link that says I pay triple when your website currently says it's a double payment.

Thought my original journey was all KQ flights, and I paid for 4 bags from Amsterdam to Abidjan, the second leg of my journey only had 2 bags covered in my baggage allowance. In other words, KQ basically robbed me as I had to leave 2 of my bags behind. Now I have to find a way to get my bags to my final destination, which is undoubtedly going to cost even more than paying for 2 bags did. I am extremely disappointed in the services that were provided. I am moving for KQ to refund me the money for my bags, seeing as I paid for a service I was not provided. ",1st September 2020

The food served remains almost inedible and inflight entertainment is virtually non-existent. Due to COVID they cancelled my ticket/s. Unfortunately, proved to be a horrendous experience as customer service is virtually non-existent. The airline doesn't respond to emails and the telephones indicated on their website does not get picked! It did not help that one is left with no option since they closed their offices. This airline needs to be more responsive to its customers (it seems to want to be known literally to go with the notion of pole-pole or slowly) if it is to get itself out of its reported financial woes due to plunging customer numbers.",11th August 2020
92,"✅ Trip Verified |  We flew from JFK to NBO just before the pandemic was declared. This was the first leg of a journey to Seychelles (SEZ). We found the cabin crew on this flight to be excellent, attentive, and really friendly. It seemed that the cabin staff were up and down the aisles very frequently and had a smile on their faces, something that must be tough during these times. We told them how pleased we were at the end of the flight and they seemed genuinely surprised to get the positive feedback. We passed this on to the airline via their website but have received no response as yet. Check in at JFK was easy, but probably atypical due to the reduced number of flyers in early March this year. The same could be said for the boarding process. The plane itself was new, a lovely 787 with mood lighting and big windows. The legroom was reasonable (not cramped but not luxurious). Overall it was comfortable for such a long journey. The food on the outbound journey was really good, way better than we expected, and our son' child's meal was also better than typical kids meals. The biggest negative on our outbound journey was the entertainment system. There were very few recent movies and the choice was extremely limited. Take your tablet or phone and download some eBooks, movies or other entertainment to it. if you are expecting to use the system on the plane to keep you occupied for 14 hours you will be disappointed. If I was rating the airline based on this flight I would actually give this flight 4 or even 5 stars as it was enjoyable but external factors are influencing that rating. Our return journey from Seychelles was delayed overnight by 14 hours and we had to fight to get accommodation. Due to this delay, and the Kenyan government ban on entry for foreigners due to COVID-19, it also meant our mini KQ Safari booked through the airline had to be cancelled. This is all very understandable and we have no issue with any of that. We cancelled this over email with the safari division while in the Seychelles and assumed there would be no issue. However, despite meeting 3 of the criteria needed for refund I am now going through a VISA charge-back process to recover this fee. First they say to talk to travel agent (when we booked the safari directly through them on a different credit card number) and then they say its valid for a year and they do not refund services .. despite having a clear statement on their website that a refund can be done if you fit 1 of the 3 criteria - 1. contact the email provided within 24 hours of the safari to cancel (we did it 6 days before), 2. Have a flight cancellation or delay (we were cancelled and put on a flight 14 hours later), and 3. Being denied entry to the country (the government were denying foreign nationals even with a visa - which we had). We want to go back to the Seychelles when all this is over but sadly I fear it will need to be with another airline, despite the stellar service of the staff on KQ003 on the day we flew.",19th May 2020

Due to COVID-19, the airline appropriately cancelled my trip, however, would not give me any sort of refund for the ticket price. I reached out to them multiple times prior to the flight with no response or call back. Finally, 2 days ago (almost a month after my flight was scheduled), I received a response stating that I did not qualify for a refund since it was a non-refundable ticket, even though they cancelled the flight. They wouldn't even give me a travel voucher by this point! If you can fly anyone else, please do. I had multiple international trips planned during this time and every other airline worked with me to refund my trip or provide me with flight vouchers.

96,"✅ Trip Verified |  Nairobi to Mauritius This was the final leg of the itinerary from Manchester to Mauritius (Manchester to Nairobi flown with Qatar Airways) - flights sold by Qatar Airways. This flight was a short 4 hour flight. Nairobi Airport itself if not the best for transit, though we spent the 7 hour layover in the Pride Business Class Lounge (having paid $40 for a day pass) which was satisfactory. Cabin Crew appeared a little unfriendly on arrival onto aircraft, though pleasant with requests and service. The aircraft itself appeared old and tired, and could benefit from modernisation. For a small flight, a light meal was provided, which in honesty was good (Asian Vegetarian). Sadly few flight announcements and no advice that the plane was descending into Mauritius and landing - it just landed! No inflight entertainment - screen did not work! Finally the timing of this flight is not good. Arrival at Mauritius at 0300 in the morning is strange and untimely. Not sure why the schedule is this way, but certainly not a time that I would be looking at again in the future. In summary, an ‘ok’ airline - convenient to ensure Qatar Airways flights for the route, but will look at alternatives to Mauritius in the future. Put it this was, if Qatar Airways either fly directly to Mauritius, or have a transit in Seychelles or Johannesburg, then this would be the preferred option. Nairobi is ok, but I think the experience with Kenya Airways is not something I would revisit as experienced.",1st April 2020

No luggage issues. Checked in online. Had to wait 1 hour in airport as they only open check in 2 hours before departure. Upgraded 1st leg KGL-NBO by a modest, but successful online bid. Granted lounge access by courtesy in Nairobi as my Gold Card was just earned during the same trip (but of course not processed in their system). In Kigali they use Pearl lounge which is deteriorating since Rwandair opened a new lounge opposite. Kenya Airways Pride Lounge in Nairobi is wonderful. Food served onboard was substandard and particular breakfasts were a disgrace. However, drink supplies were fine. I like the “Happy Hours” approach they use on regional routes like to Dubai and JNB where you order a drink or wine and they often double up the order without asking. I have only received this double up service before on Gulf Air and the now deceased Jet Airways. That is generous, positive approach and make one feel very appreciated and cared for in economy class where benefits otherwise are sparse. FAs are very good though advised an FA to avoid chewing gum as it is cause feeling of disrespect to some passengers. Champagne on business class is good and offered also before departure. No IFE on short legs but on long legs plenty of films to watch. No WiFi onboard. I was given 3 seats on all flights were not full thanks to corona virus fear and close downs.",17th March 2020

I had made a low, but successful bid for 2nd leg to be upgraded as it also gave access to Kenya’s Lounge in Nairobi which is good and spacious. Ticket cheap, bought from an online travel company. Kenya Airways have reduced luggage allowance for regional flights, with Silver level in their Flying Blue FFP I eventually managed to get a 2nd, huge suitcase, added to be check-in (first one included in ticket). Check-in, transfers, and communication went fine. Onboard, great service, lots of drinks as there seem to be a Happy Hour going on at afternoon/evening flights. Whenever passengers ordered juice, beer or wine they were instantly handed double up without discussion. I love that attitude. It gives a feeling of luxury. I have experienced this before with KQ (on their Dubai route). Food was good, two options with the possibility to add up more as long stock lasted. FAs were fine. Call bells answered. Duty free sales onboard worked well. The Dreamliner is great but space provided in economy is humiliatingly small. I was lucky to have 3 seats to myself to survive lack of leg and breathing space. Pride lounge in Nairobi is a breeze and I slept well till next morning to catch last leg as being upgraded. Last leg morning flight NBO-KGL was uneventful. Of 9 business class seats (1 x 2 configuration). No complaints apart from a joke of “breakfast” consisting of a tired, reheated croissant. No cheese, only jam to supply.

101,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bangkok to Johannesburg via Nairobi on 5th February 2020. Both flights on newer B787-8 aircrafts. Check-in and luggage handling went smoothly, but had to fight a bit with ground staff to get all my BPs issued on spot. Booking handling online works well. Their AF-KLM lounge offered in Bangkok is poor (like Thai Airways lounges) but their Pride lounge in Nairobi is good and spacious. Hardware on Kenya Airways is good and they are good on ground to tackle even complicated issues. The FAs are also good, plenty, observant. They are mainly Kenyans which does not help Chinese nor Thai passengers much. The very weak point of Kenya Airways is the food. Business class does not provide food any better than their Economy class and is plain, without vision, looking shabby. Competing airlines like Ethiopian, Turkish, South African, and Egypt serves much better and inspiring food in their economy class. Steel cutlery and table preparation nice. But that’s it. Dinner from BKK was a cold shabby dish with chopped salad and 3 ridiculous small pieces of sliced meatballs. Breakfast offered was inedible continental or fried rice. Very poor offerings. No meat, no cocktails, no cheeses, no ice cream, no smoothies, chocolates, no fruits (watermelon does not count). Extremely poor catering, a disgrace for the airline. Beverages are shamefully very sparse, only 2 juices (apple or orange) are offered. Wines are only passable. Beers are cheap, waterish industrial stuff: 2 brands, Tusker and Heineken – not providing any alternatives to each other. No souvenir, no pyjamas, no luxury feelings at all. No lobster, no seafood, no caviar, no mutton, goat, pork, no beef, no chicken (maybe inside the breakfast sausage). FA staff admitted that economy class had the same catering as business though of course presented simpler. 1st flight on time, 2nd departed 1 hour late. Miles given quickly to Flying Blue.

The Boeing 787 is a great plane, but from check-in to baggage collection and everything in between I was underwhelmed. The aircraft interior is tatty and dirty with frayed seat covers and ripped seat-back pockets that your phone falls through the holes. The cabin service only started 45 minutes after take-off, no water or drinks and they first serve their very mediocre meals before you get a small plastic cup of water which we got 1 hour into the flight. Then the dirty trays only get cleared around an hour after meals are served so you can’t stow the tray table and sleep until they’ve cleared the cabin. On both the flight to Bangkok and the return sector I tried in vain to call a cabin attendant using the call button, but they literally walk past you with the blue light glaring and carry on doing whatever they’re busy with. I needed assistance on one occasion as the passenger next to me spilled their whole drink over me and I needed a towel to dry my leg and shoes, but after 20 minutes I eventually switched off the light and gave up and slept with a wet leg. On another occasion I needed the attendant to take my dirty food tray (nearly a full hour after the meal had been served) so that I could stow my fold down tray to get up to go to the bathroom but he refused to take it and said I must wait until they clear the whole cabin. I chose Kenya Airways because it was the quickest trip with shortest connection and I assumed there would be similar service to AF / KLM with them being shareholders, but if I ever fly to Bangkok again from Johannesburg I will certainly pay the extra money and take the longer layover in Dubai or Singapore and fly Emirates or Singapore Airlines, I will not fly Kenya Airways long-haul again unless it’s specifically to go to Nairobi or elsewhere in East Africa.",8th January 2020
103,"Not Verified |  Just returned after spending nearly 10 hours at OR Tambo airport. Flight was cancelled due to a faulty spring on a flap. While I recognise theses things happen I was appalled by the way the staff treated customers. Little or no information was given. KQ staff were almost completely absent except when tracked. Sent from pillar to post trying to find luggage, no lunch vouchers provided, then informed you had to re-book yourselves on flights so complete mayhem trying to get to the KQ reservation desk back in the departures, non airside counter. Was informed no compensation except for new booking would be provide and if needed a hotel. I have family in Pretoria so headed back to them, incurring extra costs such as taxi fares but no compensation for these and all the other costs incurred let alone any compensation for wasting my and my 2 kids whole day, losing a days work, missing appointments etc. Am absolutely amazed at how badly KQ staff in Johannesburg are trained. This is not the first time. Last year when they lost my luggage for 3 days, KQ staff at ORTambo failed to inform me I was due 100 usd compensation.

Our flight was delayed for over 10 hours because there was no crew availability. Because of that our connecting flight was missed, and we were rescheduled to a flight, which made us reach Mumbai 25 hours late. When we reached the airport, the system was not working, and we were given hand written boarding passes. The process delayed the flight by more than 4 more hours.

We went to their office at Entebbe and found a staff who was very unprofessional and unwilling to help. When we indicated that we are gold members and frequent flyers and we wish to file a complaint and asked for her name, then she was willing to assist us.

Far too much single use packaging - throwaway boxes, plastic cutlery when they could just as easily use stainless steel cutlery. No special meals on 2/4 of my flights and staff insisted this was not booked even when I was presented with my meal on 2 of other legs. Had to wait at least 30 minutes both times in Nairobi in the plane after landing in the heat as ground staff got the disembarkation ready but no apology or explanation from cabin staff for keeping people standing in the hot crowded airplane.

107,Not Verified |  Cape Town to Zanzibar via Nairobi. Worst experience of my life. We booked online directly from Kenya Airways on the 2nd Nov and the money was deducted on the 8th November. The day we booked we noticed a flight was cancelled and we phoned them to make sure seeing as we didn't receive an e-ticket. The woman said it's no problem we will receive our ticket the moment the flight is sorted we just need our booking reference. On the 15th Dec we were suppose to fly at 2300. With check-in they couldn't find our ticket and was sent to ticket sales. Ticket sales confirmed that we had paid and that we have a booking but no tickets were issued. When Kenya was finally reached they said they never received our payment. 2.5 hours later we missed our flight. Next day we start phoning them at 7am. When they finally answered they started this thing where they will tell you to please hold but end the line. After the fourth call we got through and the woman said we can fly at 14:30. At 10am we were at the airport at ticket sales. Once again no e-ticket and no response. By 12:30 we get the news. We have to pay for new tickets at a larger price than our previous tickets and they will refund our original price .. the absolute audacity. We lost our vacation and accommodation and these people wanted to charge us extra? Customer service is enough to make even the most calm and professional person lose it completely. We received a proof of refund and on the proof it shows that they received our money on the 6th November.,18th December 2019

When she came back told us that it is too late and we should go to gate 6 and check for another flight and they will provide the service. We went there waiting 30 mins. No one showed up so I went to the previous gate desk to ask for assistance. She called a few numbers and informed me that her colleague is there all the time. When I went back to the desk by gate 6 my friend told me that she just arrived 2 mins ago and she is not able to help us as she doesn't have codes and we need to wait for someone else an hour. We waited for another person and she couldn't help us too. We kept waiting for 3rd person another 40 mins who said that we can't change the ticket coz the plan is full.

There was good leg room and the seats were comfortable. The inflight entertainment was touchscreen and provided a large selection of movies to watch. Three meals were provided during the 2 flights. My only issue was the long transit in Nairobi (8 hours) on the way to Mauritius. The transit on the journey back was quick (only 2 hours). I will definitely fly Kenya Airways again, as it was the cheapest option to Mauritius and provided great value for money.",15th November 2019
114,"✅ Trip Verified |  Nairobi to New York . The food is below average for someone who is paying almost $1000 for a flight. We received what they called a omelette which was really like the folded egg from mcdonalds, chicken with rice and a buffalo chicken sandwich that was terrible. Completely unacceptable at the quality given to customers. Kenya airways also had a separate security checkpoint after three were already done in the airport at the gate. In which anyone who purchased a beverage walking in the airport and then went to their gate were told it had to be consumed right then or thrown out. Water in the airport is $3, I saw at least 10 passengers who had to throw their water out and some after being told by a worker who sold them the water that they would be fine to board the plane. Also an observation, we were the only one with a checkpoint done by the airline at the gate. We walked by all other gates and saw people sitting like you normally would. So why would this airline impose a checkpoint for those going to the US after already being checked by the airport and customs. This left a bad taste after a great trip. Do better Kenya airways.

I booked a flight with another airline from Nairobi-Zanzibar, money was deducted but I was not issued a ticket. I was at Nairobi on the day of travel waiting to get the tickets and travel with my family. We were told the Airline had canceled our tickets .. (later on the airline would refund me the money deducted).  A ticket lady booked us a flight to Zanzibar and she went further to assist us with immigrations so that we do not miss the flight.

116,"✅ Trip Verified |  My family of four flew business class Bangkok to Nairobi return. I had purchased my business class ticket and 3 economy tickets for my family, 6 months in advance, all at a great price. My family got upgraded to business class 48 hours before each flight based on a computerized bidding system. Although it is not guaranteed you will get the seats, in our case it saved us thousands of dollars on our business class airfares. Kenya uses a 2x2x2 seat configuration in a two cabin business class design. Three rows in the front cabin, and two rows in the next cabin. The second cabin is quieter and more desirable. The flight attendants, both Kenyan and Thai were great - very friendly and attentive. Since both our flights were ""Red Eyes"", we went right to sleep for the 9 hour flight and did not eat the first meal. The pre-arrival meal was breakfast and was fine. The IFE was just average with a limited number of movies, most over a year old. I fly a lot of long haul business class flights and usually prefer the individual pods, but in this case with my family, the two side by side business class seats were very comfortable. In fact they had longer leg room and were wider than the pods, allowing you to sleep easily on your side without feeling constricted. We all got 7-8 hours of sleep. Our first flight arrived 45 minutes early. Our second flight 30 minutes late. All in all a comfortable flight with very good service.",3rd November 2019

119,"✅ Trip Verified |  We missed our 8.30am Kenya Airways flight (the airlines fault, not ours) from Nairobi to Kilimanjaro. The staff at the Kenya Airways desk initially insisted that we pay the full fare for a new flight at 5.00pm. when we refused to do so they said there were Business Class seats available on the 1.30pm flight which we could have for the difference between economy and business. We were told twice that the difference was $US210 per person. We reluctantly agreed to pay but specified we would pay by credit card so we had a paper trail when we subsequently complained to KA. We were told that if we paid cash we could pay at the Kenya Airways desk. If we insisted on paying by card we would have to go back through Security, but another visa (as we had technically left Kenya) and pay at the KA desk on the concourse. When my partner eventually got to the Kenya Airways concourse desk the staff insisted that he needed to pay cash. When he refused they suggested they would void the reserved Business Class seats. He continued to insist on paying by card. At this point the price for the upgrade mysteriously dropped from $US210 to $US184 per person. Our conclusion was that the relevant Kenya Airways staff had intended to take the additional $US52 as a “commission “. By the way, my partner wasn’t required to buy another visa. And we discovered on the flight that our upgrade to Business Class entitled us to the grand total of a glass of water and a wet towel! We will never use Kenya Airways again.",24th October 2019

121,"✅ Trip Verified |  I was to fly on Sept 7th 10.55 pm Kenya time from Nairobi to New York/JFK. I got to the airport and cleared 3 rounds of security checks. After reaching the boarding gate, it was announced that the flight is delayed and now will depart at 1 am.   Around 9.30, they made another announcement that the flight is further delayed and will depart at 2 am. We were offered some dinner and around midnight asked to proceed towards the boarding gate where there was another round of security clearance, there is no water available beyond this point unless it’s a sealed bottle bought at duty-free.   At around 2.45, when there was no sight of a plane and when we inquired with the ground staff, Kenya Airways personnel made an announcement that the flight is canceled and will now depart at 2 pm the next day.   We were given transit visa voucher, however, upon getting to the Immigration line, were told the voucher is void without KA personnel signature. By this time, all of us were frustrated due to lack of proper communication and guidance.   After we cleared the long queue at Immigration, we got to the KA desk for the hotel reservation. There was no clarity or communication around hotel assignment. We had to hand over our boarding passes at random to agents who’d then shout out the names of passengers. As the lines grew longer, their ability to manage crowds and cater to our needs diminished – they were not able to answer simple questions such as which hotel to go to, when our bus/shuttle would arrive or what the process would be thereafter.   We managed to get to our assigned hotel at around 4.30 am. The wifi in the room was not working so we could not communicate with family regarding our whereabouts. The bedspread was torn and the bathroom had roaches and other insects. With barely 3 hours of sleep, we woke up to get breakfast which was below average.   We left for the airport by airport shuttle where the KA agent only provided boarding pass for the flight to JFK. The agent asked me to go to the gate to collect boarding pass for the flight from JFK- PHX. After reaching the gate, I was asked to go to the KA desk so the agent can further help with flight changes. I had specifically requested to be booked onto an earlier flight which the agent at the main counter confirmed was the case. However, the agent at the KA desk near the gates could not help and said they could book me only on the 8 am flight to Phoenix the following day – after an 8+hour wait at JFK airport, she said my seat was confirmed for this flight. The agent also confirmed my bags would be checked all the way through to Phoenix and just that I had to collect my boarding pass at KA counter at JFK.   At the fourth security check, I asked another KA agent if my bags would be through checked to Phoenix – she said I would have to collect them at the port of entry which is NY/JFK.  The flight which was to depart at 2 pm was delayed by an hour and departed Nairobi at around 3 pm. The in-flight service was poor, the agents were rude. I asked the attendant for an additional blanket as I started feeling the chills but I never got any.   We landed at JFK around 10.30 pm. After clearing customs/immigration, transiting passengers were advised to meet the ground staff. There was no ground staff at JFK for us to meet. So at around 11.45 pm (after clearing customs), I along with another passenger, headed to the KA counters on Level 2/boarding gates area.

Kenya Airways food is going downhill - flown with them before and the food was more substantial. Return flight - Lusaka to Nairobi via Harare - a packet of salted nuts and a drink. Nairobi to London - ""lunch"" was a very small offering allegedly breakfast of a poached egg and spinach - again in a cardboard box. This is not the way for a cash strapped airline to attract or keep customers. Cabin crews were unsmiling but did the job.

On all four legs of this trip food was very poor indeed - on three legs we were served identical ""breakfast boxes"" which consist of a tiny croissant,and a small cake - no butter etc that was all. On the outward leg from London to Nairobi there was also a reasonable evening meal but on the return leg the ""lunch"" was miniscule. There were no visible water runs and the cabin crews did little outside the ""meal"" service. Marketing seems to use the wrong strategy to keep customers - the whole concept of customer service seems to be going in the reverse direction. Both aircraft types are clean but the seats are so hard and uncomfortable from years of use. Having flown with them before the whole trip was very disappointing. On the credit side the flights were all on time. If Kenya airways want to attract and keep customers they should review the so called meal options and not advertise ""breakfast"" on the e tickets when it clearly does not apply- a breakfast box is not a meal - buy something at the airport !",10th October 2019

On the first flight business class was full and people were cramped in 1 x 2 configuration. For solo travellers its important to select the single seats on the left (column A). Welcome champagne given provided the passengers request it, otherwise it is not offered. They had two food options (veg. or chicken) which both were ridiculous, loaded from Nairobi: 1 to pick of chicken or vegs with a ground potato cake, total some 50 grams served on a disgusting. Seats are classic Business class with limited reline. Cannot justify the high price tag for business class on short flights. In Nairobi I used the wonderful Pride Lounge to catch up with Premier League. The longer leg NBO-DXB was much nicer and a true business class experience. I had two hot kinds of hot meals and they were both acceptable (fish and steak). Staff well-rested and in a sparkling mood. IFE fine. Roomy lie flat beds. Food is deteriorating, really bad and poor compared to earlier years of glory. No quality beers and only 1 or 2 wines offered. And the 2 beer brands they offer are just industrialised mass products of low quality.

128,"✅ Trip Verified | Johannesburg to Paris return. Kenya Airways does the job but don't expect much more than flying from A to B. On the good side, flight hours are convenient from Johannesburg to Paris and route is short. Flights were all on time, with short connections. KQ is part of the AF-KLM Flying Blue programme and that's very convenient (I'm Silver and got 3x23 kilos). FAs were fine and as already experienced on KQ they tended to be very generous on alcohol. On the downside KQ offers very poor service. IFE is extremely poor, with a very limited choice of films, most being rather old films, and the selection did not change between late July and late August! Besides IFE did not always work fine (sound problem on one flight). Food was very limited and very bad, particularly on 8 hour flight to Paris: no real dinner but just a fat meat roll, breakfast very bad - but food better from CDG as on so many airlines. NBO airport is small and clean, it was not crowded but very dull and very limited service. Ground staff at OR Tambo wanted us to pay for our children's car seats (about $ 400!) because on the website it was written that car seats were free for ""infants"" and they said children (aged 4 and 9) are not ""infants"" - very absurd rule! Hopefully the agent at the ticketing office was shocked by the price and sorry for us and finally they dropped the surcharge (as always, be kind with ground staff and stay calm!). Yet we saw latter the same ground staff member telling very rudely to a passenger going to Malawi that he would have to pay for a not-so-big cabin bag he was carrying. KQ's service is clearly very poor and among African airlines SAA and Ethiopian, while far from being perfect, offer better service, particularly IFE, food and cabins.",14th September 2019

As a frequent flyer KQ, I asked their customer service if I could be given a voucher for the business lounge as they had made the changes. The short retort was 'No'. My retort to Kenyan Airways - I have now cancelled my booking and will be flying Ethiopian Airways direct from Cape Town to Addis Ababa return. No wonder Kenya Airways is also experiencing hard times, it all relates to service, on the ground and in the air.

Every flight attendant was rude. The bathrooms were dirty and were not cleaned or restocked duringthe entire flight. Unsanitary and disgusting. This airline is subpar and should be reviewed by health departments. The staff should be replaced or retrained. There are plenty of Kenyan citizens who could use the work.

133,"✅ Trip Verified |  Dubai to Kigali via Nairobi. On time. KQ cannot handle transit luggage in Dubai anymore. This happens frequently to me as I often travel on a different ticket onwards from DXB when transiting. One has to hire a ground handling company DNATA (?) and pay them 90 USD to retag two suitcases forward. Instead, I opted to pass twice not only immigration but also security and train commuting. Had to reclaim my bags and check them in again at landside. Otherwise, everything went perfect. I sleep well on the Boeing 787, prefer the middle seats on 2nd row. FAs pleasurable and I allowed them to change my seat. I bought the tickets a year in advance and could at that time not connect easily to Kigali from Nairobi. Earlier flights are now available, but I opted not to change and killed my 12 hours in Pride Lounge in Nairobi with pleasure and in great comfort. Last flight on Embraer, also faultless. But inflight service poor and food is a joke: a single, cold, unappetizing sandwich. I wonder what they can serve cheaper for economy class. Beers and wine available but hidden not displayed on wagons. Business class was full and people were cramped in 1 x 2 configuration. Headsets were for economy class and only given on request. Luggage delivered at belt as some of the very last ones, more than 35 Minutes after passing immigration. No point of Priority Tags. Delay caused by examination of all bags prior to releasing them! I could hear the sniffing dogs they use to disclose drugs. An airport thing, but passengers are suffering from this which also apply for departures.

134,"✅ Trip Verified |  Nairobi to Johannesburg return. Both flights delayed. A 3-hour delay out of Nairobi with no prior communication from the airline despite the fact that they ask for both your phone number and email address when you check in online. I actually received a text advising me of the delay after we landed in Johannesburg a full 3 hours late. Apparently the delay was caused by a technical issue with the airplane scheduled to operate the flight but the chaos at Nairobi Airport and a glance at the departure board showed most Kenya Airways flights delayed on the day for anything up to 8 hours! I'm skeptical that a technical issue on one airplane could cause that many delays, given the size of the airline and the different aircraft types it operates. The flight itself was fine, despite several irate passengers taking their frustration out verbally on the cabin crew who kept up a cheerful demeanor as much as they could. Food on KQ is nothing special, a tiny main course and a bread roll and bit of cake. Entertainment options are fine but don't seem to be updated much. Return flight from Johannesburg two days later also delayed 1 hour due to the flight departing Nairobi late. This time apparently they had a medical emergency with a passenger just after pushing back from the gate in Nairobi which meant they had to go back and put the unfortunate person in an ambulance. Not the airline's fault I suppose but frustrating nonetheless when constant delays are the norm with the airline these days. Being a frequent traveler to Johannesburg, I think I'll use their competitor on the route in future.",2nd September 2019
135,"Not Verified | Amsterdam to Dar es Salaam via Nairobi. During the outward journey, I had a three-hour delay from Nairobi to Dar es Salaam. The airport in Nairobi has very poor facilities so the wait was very unpleasant. During the flight to Dar Es Salaam, I left my headphones on the chair. A day later I contacted immediately but apparently, my headphones disappeared in a 'mysterious' way. I contacted the company several times but after their first reaction, they found it too difficult to answer my follow-up questions. The return journey was even more dramatic. My flight was moved from the morning to the evening without consultation. I had received an email about this. So I wanted to check-in in the evening, but this was not possible. The change was passed on to me but apparently was not in the airport system. So I had to wait an hour and a half at customer service. The lady who thought her phone was more important than her customers couldn't help me. According to her, the fault lay with me. Because I had booked the flight via KLM, I went to the KLM office just in time. The staff there were able to check me in within five minutes and clearly stated that the fault was with Kenya Airways. Fortunately, I was just able to make my flight. How lucky that I booked the flight via KLM. The organization of Kenya Airways is lacking at every level.",28th August 2019
136,"✅ Trip Verified | I'm very happy with the service. I had a flight from Bangkok via Nairobi to Addis. Originally I booked the flight with a transit time in Nairobi. So I arrived in the morning and the original flight was supposed to go in the evening. In Bangkok they also checked me in for the second flight in Nairobi. Although I had the boarding pass I didn't realize that the time had changed to the morning flight. I was so sure that the flight would be in the evening that I read the time 6.35 as the evening time, although that's obviously in the morning. When I finally realized this they booked me on the next flight for the next morning and booked a hotel with 2 meals included, plus the shuttle all for free. So very thankful for everything and I also got the transit Visa renewed without extra cost. I can recommend this airline for the good service and my good impression I had for the flight from Bangkok to Nairobi. Thanks a lot Kenya Airways.",23rd August 2019
137,"✅ Trip Verified |  Kigali-Bujumbura-Nairobi-Dubai on 31 July 2019 on an old E190 and on a newer B787, respectively. Faultless travels, first flight to NBO via BJM on time, 2nd flight delayed 70 Minutes. Check in KGL was fine but slow. Could not check in my baggage to final destination but at least they could transfer it beyond DXB on another airline, which made me OK. Service onboard fully acceptable, 3 types of small, cold sandwiches on brown bread. Wines of RSA origin, acceptable but not memorable. Transit in NBO smooth, jetbridge deboarding and boarding. Flights were both full in economy cabin, but service inboard was managed well and thoroughly. No IFE on first flight. Detour to BJM very annoying. FAs were fine, nothing too much trouble. Due to delay on 2nd flight they granted me access to the wonderful Pride Lounge in NBO, that was a nice move, and I enjoyed really and filled up my depots. I love this lounge due to its space, curved form, good food, and views of tarmac. Second flight had IFE, good food, and generous drink rounds. I had lamb, 1 of 3 options for hot meal. FAs were in splendid mood – twice I ordered a drink and both times I got one extra “as bonus”. Seats with amble space. Ticket was cheap and provided excellent value for money.",2nd August 2019
138,"Not Verified |  New York to Dar es Saalam via Nairobi. We will never fly this airline again. We flew JFK to Nairobi non-stop on June 29th and returning on July 11th. Firstly, the customer service is unbelievably terrible. Every stewardess  was rude, and never helped . They huffed and puffed when you kindly requested something as simple as some water (flight was over 14 1/2 hours). Secondly, they refused to accommodate anyone for seat changes, even when the customer is paying the upcharge. Third, we requested to get skymiles added from this trip and they refuse to give us our credit due to our ""class"". They are a part of the SkyTeam. We spent extra money on exit row seats and spent a lot of money for the tickets. How are we not getting any mileage credit built up from this. This is probably the number one reason I will never fly with this airline ever again. I am so angry with this. Bathrooms were dirty and never cleaned or restocked. There was several times that I had to walk to the back of the plane to find a stewardess and ask them to put more toilet paper in the bathroom or if there was any way they could clean the urine off the floor in every single one of the bathrooms. We paid for exit seats for the additional leg room and the stewardesses never said anything to the 15 people that decided to congregate in my extra leg room area and stand there conversating for over 2 hrs. I asked them kindly to relocate several times and even said something to the stewardesses several times. Finally, they moved after I had to make them (very frustrating). I didnt pay all this extra money for me not to be able to extend my legs. The only good thing I can say about this airline is they got us from point A to point B. ",27th July 2019
139,"✅ Trip Verified |  Dubai to Kigali via Nairobi on 30th June 2019 on B787-800 and E190, respectively. My ticket was in economy and very cheap. I bid for an upgrade for the 1st leg and it was accepted 2 days before and they reissued ticket. However, due to serious delays by Cathay Pacific entering Dubai (from Saigon and Hong Kong), I realised almost a day before that I would not be able to make my trip from DXB. I cancelled my online check-in’s to avoid No Show, but had to forfeit upgrade and tickets according to fare rules. However, KQ, and in particular the Station Manager in DXB, went the extra mile to still get me on board on the following flight 5 hours later on the same day. This, without reissuing tickets (which were non refundable), without charging me for No Show, without loosing my upgrade, just out of courtesy, empathy and a well explained case from my side. At gate in DXB, I was the last person (had only 40 Minutes for transfer, so got a good morning run!), but KQ issued all my BPs in 2 Minutes during last call. Onboard, spacious cabin, got seat 2C in a nice 2 x 2 x 2 configuration. Flight full except a few seats in business. Good food and kind, attentive FAs. A decent airline respecting classic values and handles “ground situations” or irregularities well. Not the first time they have done small miracles for me. In NBO, I was kindly invited to the KQ Pride lounge that Skyteam uses. Just a courtesy due to my endured inconveniences. Last leg on an E190, I love this aircraft. Dinner and drinks served in a good atmosphere due to fresh FAs. Well done, KQ, outstanding service: I owe you for this one! And my home-travel is still valid. What more could you have done?

On board eventless, and FAs were in a good mood. Aircraft 80% full(?). Drinks fine. Inedible baked snack served. Special meals not provided. Trip was rescheduled by Kenya Airways due to a long term announced cancellation of a leg, which became complicated as I had 6 legs on my entire journey.

142,"✅ Trip Verified |  Addis Ababa to Kigali via Nairobi on 16-17th May 2019 on B737 and E90, respectively. Got my ticket reissued in airport in ADD due to No Show (I was late from previous connection on different ticket). That costed me 300 usd, same amount as I paid for original (return) ticket. The Station Manager in ADD went the extra mile to get me onwards the same day and he invited me to the Ethiopian Gold Lounge, that Skyteam uses. Service onboard fair, but food is ridiculous and substandard. They serve only microscopic meals, e.g. a little-finger sized hot roll snack from ADD to NBO (5 hours trip). That’s stingy. In NBO I had to spent the night but fortunately KQ granted me lounge access due to all the trouble that I have had. The prestigious lounge has food, views, and nice architecture with curving designs and view of tarmac. It has 6 beds in silent area and I slept well till next morning. Flights less than ½ hours delayed. NBO-KGL on the Embraer was delayed due to passengers could not fit their overhead luggage into the narrow space and some 5-10 pax was deprived their luggage to have it inscribed on site and put down in luggage room until we reached KGL. For me a dramatic flight as I had 6 BPs issued with KQ and lost 2 connections from ADD but the station manager did well to rebook me. KQ has lowered services onboard but remain strong when things go wrong. No IFE on any of these 3 regional flights",18th May 2019
143,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bangkok to Addis Ababa via Nairobi. Transited in BKK from Vietnam and boarded after midnight 15th May 2019. Aircraft were the old Boeing 787-8 and 737, respectively. I like KQ (we have had our issues). In BKK they were professional and appeared as a true legacy carrier This, even I travelled on a strongly promoted ticket. Smooth cooperation with KQ and the AF lounge in BKK allowed me to relax in the lounge 6 hours until Kenya Airways could issue all 4 Boarding Passes of my ongoing trip to Kigali via Addis. Buying 2 tickets with complicated routing (married segments) turned out to be much cheaper than go direct. But time spent increases; likewise the risk of lapses. All flights punctual. Food only passable, only 2 options offered and only cold dishes for dinner. No cheese, no ice-cream. Other airlines do better in Economy regarding food. Drinks also very narrow offering with 2 industrial, cheap beers. Same for wines: only 1-2 options. Champagne offered (on both flights) was fine: JM Gobillard & Fils. The Boeing 787-8 offer a very boring and cramped layout of 2x2x2 in 5 rows. Business almost full (only 4 vacant seats) and economy completely full (but no operational upgrades were done). Second flight almost empty. Poor food, only a quiche in a paper box offered as breakfast. And, this was business class? FAs in excellent mood. Had 50 minutes turnaround time in ADD which I failed to complete in time due to no prior notification by KQ aircrew to ground staff to rush me through.",18th May 2019

It was this way both ways on our trip. ,6th May 2019
145,"✅ Trip Verified |  Nairobi to Dakar via Abidjan. I have no idea why the airline is called the Pride of Africa. Maybe because it compares to some other very bad airlines in the region. Ok, the plane seemed good and the seats had a PTV which is pretty good and a newly introduced feature. That's about it. At Jomo Kenyatta the check in was slow, even for those having done a check in online, we had to wait in a line, no one told us which line to wait in and of course no drop off line, unlike advertised in the web page ... and there is no point in using the self check in machines, as you still have to go on the line  inside the airport, which is not the fault of the airline it is really hot and crowded, but the airline did not help because their boarding was done all at the same time, no groups. Once in the tarmac, maybe because they wanted to use only one bus, they waited a long time until we were really crowded and people started complaining and saying they would not get in the bus, then they took us to the plane where we waited about 5 to 10 minutes on the tarmac again (luckily it was sunny). We board the plane and have to wait almost one hour because the pilots do not have a flight plan. I go to the toilet even before taking off and it is very dirty already. Food was really bad for an almost 10h flight. Seat covers were falling off some seats. Entertainment is good but there is a problem... every time you open a new film, or show or whatever, it shows you the same publicity again, (we are already flying Kenya airways, no need to see the publicity 20 times). The publicity lasts about 7 minutes and runs over the show, so once your movie or show begins, you've lost a few minutes of it . that is something that they must fix. In the stopover, we were advised that we had to wait in the plane about 30 minutes. We waited 2h without air conditioning, over 40 degrees, people complaining, doors closed and of course no APU on, nor auxiliary power, why?  Food from Abidjan to Dakar was really bad .. a cold hard muffin and a mince pie that tasted so bad and was so dry many did not eat it. Anyways for a 2h flight you can't expect much, but in total it is a 10h flight for many so it is rubbish. Both landings were quite hard and I am an airline fan and private pilot. The second one can be justified due to wind, but the first one, surprised about it. In general, very good plane, nice flight attendants, and good entertainment system. Food was very bad, the heat episode was ridiculous, the delay was annoying and the landings were not too good. Plane felt dirty. I like the airline but needs to improve. ",25th April 2019

Kenya Airways connects Lilongwe with Nairobi through a direct and different stopover flights via Lusaka and Nampula. I took the direct flight which leaves Lilongwe at 2:40 at night and lands in Nairobi 2 hours later. Check In at Lilongwe's Kamuzu International Airport is slow but so effective, that all passengers were checked in time and the flight left 40 minutes early. The worn down Embraer E190 was clean and had personal inflight entertainment with a few movies and series. The service was basic, a small breakfast and drinks were handed out. The flight landed in time in Nairobi. Transfer through Jomo Kenyatta International Airport is rather fast and efficient, definetly the airport to transfer through in Africa. The 8h 20min flight from Nairobi to Amsterdam was on a B787-800, although it was worn down, the seat was comfortable and the inflight entertainment system was very good with a wide selection of movies and series. Service was good and the food was okay. The flight was on time in Amsterdam and I am happy to fly with Kenya Airways again in the future.",19th April 2019

Even then arrived Nairobi 50 mins early due to the strong tail wind and it was very bumpy flight. Cabin crew was attentive enough. Meal was just adequate enough. Lunch was served 1+hour into the flight and breakfast was served before landing in Nairobi. In between, there is only snack. There should be a dinner service as it was a quite long flight. The seat lacks padding for 14+ hours non-stop flight. Seat pitch and seat width are decent. AVOD Entertainment was provided; however, the choice of movie was very limited and listed mostly old movies which mostly I have seen. Ended up watching some foreign language movies which I enjoyed them. KGL-NBO flight was late due to arrival flight from Nairobi. It was a Embraer 190 craft. Seat was very comfortable which I wish they put them on the transcontinental flight. We were bused into the NBO terminal upon arrival. Had to run and cut the security screening line to make it to the gate that bound to JFK. Flight waited to get all the connecting passengers and luggage loaded onboard. The flight left about 50 mins late. And arrived JFK on time. NBO-JFK flight has different AVOD entertainment menu as it was a month later from JFK-NBO flight. The movie lineup was updated with new movies. Flight crew was attentive. Water rounds came around every 1+ hour or so. Toilets were kept cleaned. All in all, everything went well. I only have 3 things to suggest to improve – seat padding, headphone (audio was quality so bad and could not understand the dialogs), and the quality of blanket/pillow (they were very thin and debris of red blanket fabric stuck all over on the cloths).",5th April 2019

Compared to Addis Ababa, Nairobis Airport seems very organized and the security check was fast. There was good Wifi and charging ports in the waiting area. Kenya Airways uses the small Embraer E190 on its 2h and 10min flight to Lilongwe. Aircraft seemed outdated and wasnt the cleanest, but I felt comfortable and legroom was quite good. I preordered vegan lacto ovo breakfast, which consisted of a sweet and a savory samosa, both very tasty. Although it was a bit disappointing that the inflight entertainment system was not working, the captain pointed out the Kilimanjaro as we passed, which made up for this. Flight was on time in Lilongwe. So far I tried Ethiopian and Malawian Airlines in Africa and would choose Kenya Airways over those two, because transferring in Nairobi is much more relaxed than Addis Abeba.",5th April 2019
149,"✅ Trip Verified |  New York to Entebbe via Nairobi. 6 sectors flown in three weeks and very impressed by their package generally. All flights on time, good service in the air, entertainment system excellent on Boeing 787 to NYC, three good meals provided and ample(although very poor quality/cheap spirits offered) refreshments. Transiting through Nairobi at night is tedious - far too few security desks open and ruins the good work being done on the ground. The additional security measures at JKIA for the US bound flights really are something else. Staff excellent. Something great about boarding a flight in New York to a smiling Kenyan cabin crew and flight crew taking you back home. The intra-Africa flights on KQ are extremely expensive (Lusaka - Entebbe was 400 USD), but the Entebbe - New York - is an absolute bargain - sadly (for KQ but amazing for me!), the both flights Ex New York were a third full - leaving a whole row to lie out and rest.

156,"✅ Trip Verified |  Harare to New York via Nairobi. I was super excited to travel to Zimbabwe and see Africa for the first time and got the perfect excuse when one of my closest friends from college planned her wedding in Harare. My outbound flight on American Airlines was cancelled due to weather, leading to me missing my connecting flight on Kenya Airways. While this was unpleasant, no one can control the weather, and AA helped re-book me on a later Kenya Airways flight into Harare, Zimbabwe, so I made it on time to the wedding. After a few weeks of seeing Victoria Falls and making friends with lions, I got back to check into my flight back to New York with Kenya Airways. The attendant there let me know that I had been marked as a “no-show” on my outbound flight, and now my return ticket was cancelled as a result. After arguing that I clearly was re-booked on a later outbound flight, Kenya Airways told me I could get on the flight if I paid a “penalty” of $1200. As I had already paid for a round trip ticket, I indignantly refused to pay for my flight a second time and wound up missing the morning flight. Two more flights back to the States came and went, and I missed all of those flights as Kenya Airways demanded payments to let me onto a plane. I racked up hours of international cell phone call payments with American Airlines customer service and my travel agent, who all let me know that Kenya Airways was not picking up the phone, and they were the only ones who could get me on one of their planes. 16 hours later, having missed every flight that day, I finally gave in and paid the $1200 penalty, in addition to the $1600 round trip ticket I had already paid, and Kenya Airways let me on the flight back home. For the privilege of nearly doubling the cost of my plane ticket, I also had a 17 hour layover in Nairobi, after which Kenya Airways told me my flight to JFK was overbooked. Fortunately Kenya Airways did one thing right and found a seat for me onto the flight back to the States, which I had paid for twice.

157,"✅ Trip Verified |  Johannesburg to Bangkok via Nairobi. The feeling I got flying Kenya Airways for the first and last time is that it’s missing a certain culture which is so important for customer loyalty. Our trip  was the worst I’ve ever taken with any airline. And I’ve flown a lot. Everything was matter of fact. Except for the last leg from Nairobi to Cape Town through Victoria Falls (which was still the wrong return flight and 24 hours too late) all flights were delayed between two and twelve hours. The on-board meals are half the size of comparably-priced flights and mostly junk. Drinks cart selection looks like Aeroflot in the 80’s. Kenyans are warm and inviting. Is there a reason why that cannot be the same at Kenyatta airport? Is Kenya Airways not the major airline of that airport? When there’s no culture at the top, there’s no culture on the ground. Rude immigration officers, and security personnel throwing bins at passengers. The “hotel desk” which had no signs was another terrible experience. Apathetic employees did the minimum required of them. Passengers already furious to have been delayed prior, and now having missed their connections, would have to wait till morning to catch the next (wrong) flight. And when you get your hotel sorted, you’re told the bus will leave “very soon” but the truth is they wait until enough people cram the bus and only then transfer the passengers to the hotel. And everything is done at snail pace, with total disregard and matter of fact. There are many wonderful and accommodating employees along the way, but that is not the point. We all tend to remember the negative and unpleasant, but the right kind of culture has no room for negative. Customers have choice, and if enough customers stop using Kenya Airways, will that make its point? ",6th January 2019

This was all fixed within 10 minutes of chatting. On the day of travel everything went smoothly from to check in to boarding. The flight was uneventful, the service onboard was very good, the flight attendants were lovely. The food and beverages served were also good.

When the delay announcement is finally made KQ offers passengers no respite not even a snack voucher for a delay of more than 4 hours.

If your flight is not cancelled it will probably be late and you will be lucky to get your bags when you land. When you do get your bags, days later, the list of excuses is endless. You will also find some confusion from Kenya airways who think they are doing you a favor finding the bag they lost.",27th November 2018
165,"✅ Trip Verified |  Accra to Dar Es Salaam via Nairobi. We were supposed to be picked up from the airport in Dar Es Salaam by our tour guides and taken straight on a 3-day safari. We booked and paid for our flights with Kenya Airways 2 months ago believing Kenya Airways to be a reliable airline. When we arrived 2 hours prior to our flight to check in, we were told that the flight was full. Despite the fact that we had arrived within the requested time to check in and had paid 2 months prior to the flight, we were kicked off the flight. There were multiple other passengers that also were not able to check in because of too many ticket sales - 1 of them had been able to buy a ticket that same morning online despite there obviously not being any left! We purchased our tickets 2 months ago - how were there still tickets on sale the same morning and yet we, who purchased our tickets 2 whole months ago were kicked off the flight?! This is unacceptable!! Another had arrived 2.5 hour prior to departure and had still been kicked off. He had also purchased his tickets much later than we had! We were out in a hotel for the night with boarding passes printed for the next flight in 24 hours but also with the promise by Kenya Airways staff that early the next day they would try to find an alternative flight to get us to Dar Es Salaam earlier. We were already going to miss our airport pickup, who was taking us straight onto a 3-day safari for which I had already paid $300 US for. We were interrupted during breakfast to rush back to the airport. The staff told us we had been booked onto an Ethiopian Airways flight through Addis Ababa but they did not have flight details to supply us with. They cancelled our tickets for the Kenya Airways flight that night. After a long wait in line, the check-in staff found only 1 ticket, rather than 2. They couldn’t tell us arrival time in Dar Es Salaam but checked in our bags and a long time later gave us boarding passes. On checking them, we discovered our route would now include a 26-hour stopover in Addis. Not only were we leaving a day later than our initial flight, but we would be now be arriving 48 hours later - a whole 24 hours later than if we had gone with the later Kenya Airways flight. On showing the staff at Kenya airways what they had swapped us over to, they then told us the Kenya Airways flight that night was already full and we couldn't fly. Seriously, this was ridiculous. We were made to go back to the hotel and brought back to the airport that evening without any communication as to whether we would even be flying. There was no offer of any compensation for the mess made by Kenya airways - no upgrade, not even an airport lounge, no offer of a partial refund, not even an apology. Instead, we had a completely wasted day with massive amounts of stuffing around by Kenya Airways. None of it was due to anything that we did wrong. ALL of it was because they overbook their flights to make extra money. This airline can't be trusted to get you from A to B.",27th October 2018
166,"✅ Trip Verified |  On July 2, my wife and I were scheduled to fly Nairobi to London on Kenya Airways, then on to the United States on Delta. I am a US citizen and my wife is a Kenyan citizen with a US permanent resident card (aka ""green card""). All went smoothly until the agent checking paperwork at the gate immediately prior to boarding denied boarding to my wife based on the idea a transit visa was required in the UK, when in fact no transit visa is needed for our situation. To make matters worse, when my wife returned to the ticket counter for further assistance (as instructed by the gate agent), she was told there was nothing they could do for her and that she would need to purchase an entirely new ticket. She purchased a one way ticket on another airline for a sizable sum. Of course I immediately filed a complaint with Kenya Airways and insisted on reimbursement. After numerous inquiries into the status of my complaint, and being told an investigation was ongoing, I finally received an email on October 4 in which Kenya Airways admitted the situation was entirely their fault. They offered what amounted to only 20% of the cost of her ticket for compensation. After several more emails back and forth, I've concluded they will never make things right and accepted their offer. It's impossible to argue with an airline headquartered in a developing country with no real consequences for appalling customer service. Their 787 aircraft are nice, but I would stay far away from Kenya Airways. You never know what sort of shenanigans they will pull and there is no way to hold them accountable after the fact.",22nd October 2018

The airline staff were very unhelpful and not interested in the implications caused for us caused by the delay resulting in the subsequent missing of our connecting flight to Port Elizabeth from Johannesburg. The representative merely stated that there was nothing he could do and that we had no recourse since the flight to Port Elizabeth was on a separate ticket and Kenya Airways contractual obligations ended in JHB. At the airport in Nairobi while we were seated on the plane it emerged that the pilot had not arrived for work, in the end Kenya Airways asked a pilot from another airline to fly the plane.",10th October 2018

When I asked for a third, they declined. When I said that I disagree, they simply said I could file a complaint to their main office. On board, our ordered special meals were missing. Once finally arrived, my bag was missing. They managed at least to get it to my hotel within 24h. When I wanted to introduce compensation claims (for the flight and baggage delays), they sent me from one office to another. Up to this date, the claims are still pending and I am not sure to get any form of compensation for the stress, energy and extra expenses.",6th September 2018

When we arrived in Lusaka (Zambia) we were informed that the plane was technically unfit to fly to Nairobi. This caused an unexpected 6 hour delay in Lusaka. In Lusaka no announcement was given in regards as to what was going to take. As a result of this delay we missed our connecting flight in Nairobi to France which was at 23:00 hrs on the the same day. On arrival in Nairobi the following morning 31-07-2018 we were informed that the next available flight was available causing in fact a further 15 hour delay in our travel.

I and my friend were on 4 different flights and all the flight were delayed which makes me think the issues with my flight was not an isolated or rare incident. After missing the flight I asked for my luggage, they said they couldn't get it for me but assured me that it would be put on the new (Kenya airways) flight that put me on for the next day. On getting to the airport I confirmed 3 times at different stages with the ground staff and they checked (or pretended to) their computer and confirmed that my luggage was on the flight only to get to Heathrow and find out that it was never put on the flight. Then the nightmare begins, their customer service phone doesn't work, it passes you through a couple of options and then automatically drops the line. Online chat doesn't work.

172,"✅ Trip Verified |  Entebbe to London via Nairobi. Overall a very average experience, with staff generally going through the motions, medicore food, limited drinks and three-star entertainment. Excellent baggage allowance and quick connecting times make this an acceptable option on the Uganda - UK routing if the price is right. My headphone socket was broke on the day time NBO - LHR flight which was really disappointing. No sparkling water available nor Amarula. Duty free items requested not available (and I tried to order in advance which also did not work properly). Totally full flight London - Nairobi departed with a 90 minute delay on the tarmac whilst awaiting ATC issues. Captain welcomed us with a 'Good Morning' (at 7 p.m. this was slightly disconcerting) and gave us very limited information about the delay. Cabin crew went round with water on one side of the cabin - but not on ours. On time arrival into Entebbe and luggage out quickly (reassuring considering the delay in London making the connection tighter than it should have been). A cooked breakfast on either the early morning arrival into Nairobi or the 8 a.m. arrival into Uganda would have been really welcomed. Nairobi still a much better transit airport than Addis, but both carriers way short of the standards set by Qatar Airways, Emirates and KLM which also compete on this route at good prices.",1st August 2018

According to the flight information, the aircraft should have taken off at 3:00pm in Bankkok and arrived in Guangzhou at 7:00 pm on that day. However, once we checked in, we were told that the flight was delayed without detailed reason provided. Neither ground staff nor cabin crew could confirm the exact boarding time. We had been waiting restlessly for more than 5 hours without any notice or compensation. That is unacceptable. It was until 8:25 pm that the flight took off, which was 5 hours and 25 minutes later than it was supposed to be. That ruined our trip on that day. In addition, during the flight, one of passengers sitting behind me kept asking cabin crew for alcohol, it astonished me that the cabin crew continued to offer her more alcohol. Consequently, that overly-drunk lady was  out of control, singing and laughing loudly. It annoyed all the other surrounding passengers and adversely affected the safety of the flight. I tried to summon assistance from the crew. It surprised me that the crew ignored my call for four times. I cannot tolerate such bad behaviour.

Both check-ins and boarding processes were smooth and easy - except that on the first flight some passengers were allowed to carry huge quantities of hand luggage on board, causing some chaos and frayed tempers. The seats were a little narrow. On the first flight the breakfast served was expansive, with three choices offered in economy class; the lunch on the second flight was also good. The first crew were rather brusque and unsmiling -- but this was made up for by the friendly crew on the second flight (which was much less full). On both flights the crews served all the food and drinks in a few pass-throughs in the first hour, and then disappeared until landing. The flights operated on time and luggage was quick to appear.

Let's start with the flight out of Johannesburg being delayed such that I missed my connection from Nairobi to Arusha at 6:30 that evening. Upon arrival I went to the Kenya airways desk to arrange the next flight to Arusha. They proposed an 11:50pm flight. This flight actually would stop in Zanzibar first, thus arriving in Arusha at 3:10 am. I was aware of that flight. I had to ask if there was an earlier flight - hen and only then did the staff say, ""There is a Precision Air flight at 10:50pm."" I replied ""and is that a direct flight"". She answered ""yes"". I then had to connect the dots for the Kenya Air staff (as obviously they are not trained to use common sense or think of their customers at all). I politely said "" and doesn't Kenya Airways run Precision Air?"" At that point the stars aligned and she asked if I would prefer that flight, well yes, I would prefer getting to my lodge 3 hours earlier as it would be the middle of night! It gets better. I needed to return a day earlier so my agent called Kenya Airways on the cost to change - the cost they quoted was more expensive than just going on Expedia and buying new tickets from Arusha to Johannesburg on Kenya Airways. I just went ahead and bought all new tickets home to Johannesburg on a different airline. Never fly them again. They failed miserably.",10th June 2018

180,"✅ Trip Verified |  Entebbe to London via Nairobi. I recently spent some time volunteering in Uganda and whilst I was there broke and dislocated my ankle quite badly. I needed to return home a few days earlier than planned, to undergo surgery, so rebooked a flight at additional cost and requested wheelchair assistance. Upon arrival at entebbe airport, they seemed unaware of my situation despite having been informed, but did sort out some help. I also asked if it would be possible to be upgraded if there were spare seats in business class as it was important to keep my leg, which was in a cast, elevated as much as possible and particularly during a flight when it may swell more. The check in desk confirmed there were seats but that they couldn’t upgrade me there but that it should be possible in Nairobi where I would change to take an 8.5hr flight to London. At the gate in Nairobi I once again asked if it would be possible to sit in business class so I could elevate my leg. The man on the desk said that he couldn’t do anything without invoicing me but it was his attitude rather than refusal that really annoyed me. He was completely unsympathetic, laughing at me and treating me as if I was just trying to get some free perks. I was clearly in pain and the most annoying thing was that the flight was actually half full. As a goodwill gesture he’d ‘upgraded’ me to the seats with more legroom but as I explained to him when he did so, that would not help as there was nothing to rest my leg on, so it was still dangling down, putting pressure on the ankle and causing swelling. This seat was also very awkward to get in and out of due to the way the screens came out of the seat from the side and had no additional room to the side as the armrests were fixed. However, it did provide me with a great view of the business class section which was virtually empty, and I was galled to see there were several passengers in economy with at least 4 seats to themselves, enabling them to lie down for the entire flight and had they so wished to elevate their leg! At no point had the man on the desk mentioned that there were many spare seats which would have enabled me to elevate my leg quite comfortably, despite me explaining the issue. None of the air hostesses expressed any concern for my situation throughout the flight despite my obvious discomfort and attempts to create a platform from bags and cushions to rest my leg on. Whilst I understand that other people have paid for the benefit of a business class seat, I felt that in extenuating circumstances such as this, the airline could have made a goodwill gesture to ensure their passenger’s wellbeing and comfort. I will not be recommending them to others and certainly won’t be rushing back to travel with ‘the pride of Africa’ any time soon. It topped off a disappointing end to what would have been a fascinating trip, but has left a sour taste in my mouth for this particular airline.",26th May 2018

One little disappointment though which I have experienced about twice is when the on Board duty free shop catalogue indicated there was a special offer of a perfume/cologne on sale, and when I asked for it I was told it was not available, and I also knew I was the first to ask amongst the passengers. The product this time on my return trip to Lusaka on Thursday 29th March, was a SAFARI cologne for men, by Ralph Lauren, advertised at a special price, but no product, and no apology in the catalogue.

The flight-time is over 3 hours but Kenya Airways for whatever reason used the Embraer 190 which should be used only on short haul flights. Both times the cabin was full and there was not enough space in the overhead compartments for hand luggage. The seats are not comfortable and do not fully recline. It was not possible to work as the cabin was too noisy and crowded.

186,"✅ Trip Verified | A complete disappointment from start to finish. Delays can happen, but they should be communicated properly. The 45 min delay turned out to be over 2 hours. Cabin was untidy and dirty when joining the flight, which originated in Guangzhou, in Bangkok. The seat was spacious but lacked any privacy dividers or hoods, leaving one exposed to the frequent foot traffic walking up and down the cabin all night. Inflight catering in 'Premier World' was mediocre. No menu was handed to passengers. A cold chicken pie and some 'vegetarian' snack was offered alongside a small chocolate cake after take-off for this 8h30 overnight flight. No appetizer, no salad, no option of a warm meal, just some basic finger food. The crew had to be reminded to hand out the amenity kits which contain eyeshades, socks ear plugs, a pen and toothbrush. Cabin lights were dimmed but the crew didn't bother to close the curtains between the galley at the second door and the cabin, leaving the front section bright and uncomfortable. Landing in Nairobi was 1 hr 20 minutes behind schedule, ground staff made little effort to accommodate connecting passengers who missed their connection. Overall an underwhelming experience. For the same (or lower) price I would rather take in the 2 hour or so connection timw in Doha, Dubai or Abu Dhabi and fly with an airline which takes onboard service and passenger comfort seriously.",20th March 2018
187,"✅ Trip Verified |  Entebbe to Mumbai via Nairobi connecting on Jet Airways to Colombo. The ground staff was acting completely arbitrarily, and each of them had different rules. Our main problem with Kenya Airways was not on board, but with the ground staff. My husband (Ugandan) and I (German) were booked on a flight to Colombo in Sri Lanka. It was a one-way ticket. Since the Sri Lankan Visa is only for 30 days, I had another flight booked with Malaysian Airlines to Cambodia within that period. My husband and I both had E-Visas for Sri Lanka. So when we came to Entebbe Airport, the Kenya Airways Lady at the Check-In counter didn't let us board the airplane. She claimed, that Ugandan citizens weren't allowed to go to Sri Lanka on an E-Visa (Our E-Visa was already granted and even certified by the Sri Lankan Embassy in Kampala). Also, she said that we had to have a flight from Sri Lanka back to our home countries and she couldn't let us go there on a one-way ticket. When I told her about our outbound flight with Malaysian, she said that there is ""a rule, that every person has to return to their home countries within one year"", so we had to show her a ticket back to our home countries, otherwhise she wouldn't check us in. As I said, she was acting totally arbitrarily. Unbelievable. So in the end I had to book a flight for each of us back to our home countries (which I of cause cancelled immediatly once arrived in Colombo). I did it right there and then at the airport, but she still had the opinion that our E-Visas weren't ok, so we missed the flight. Then, the lady took us to the Kenya Airways office at the airport and looked for another flight for us. But since ""it was our mistake"" that we missed it, we had to pay for the change fees. She then told us to go to the Sri Lankan High Comission in Kampala the next morning and apply for the normal visa. In general this lady was very rude, when I tried to explain to her that our E-Visas were already approved etc, she told me to shut up and that she was tired of dealing with people like us. So when we went to the embassy, we talked to the ambassador personally and he was completely shocked that they wouldn't let us board the airplane, since Ugandan citizens can go to Sri Lanka on an E-Visa and ours was already approved. He gave us his personal number, so that we could call im in case we would have any problems again. The next day the Check-In lady wasn't there and we had no problems to board the airplane, even though our visa was still the same and no one asked us for return tickets to our home countries. When I sent a customer complaint to the Kenya Airways Customer Service, they answered me that they received it and would forward it to someone from the Customer Service team. But after that, I didn't receive a reply for 1 month. So just recently I e-mailed them again, saying that I am still waiting for a reply, but nothing happend. I am deeply disappointed. This was my first experience with Kenya Airways, and it was the worst thing that ever happened to me in terms of flying. Never ever did I experience something like that with any other airline. I lost a lot of money and I didn't even receive an apologetic message from them, not even talking about compensation for the inconvenience. I would never recommend this airline to anyone! Don't fly with Kenya Airways if you don't want to have incidents like this, just save your time, money and energy and fly with other airlines like Qatar or Emirates.",19th March 2018

Seamless check in service with Delta Airlines Elite Medallion Members is a excellent service Kenya Airways offers.

The big issue with me was the seats, they were extremely uncomfortable in Economy. Even with a neck pillow, the seats were hard and cramped. This will become a challenge for passengers on their soon to start non-stop to New York, sitting 15.5 hours on these seats would not  be something I would do.

Quoted me a little lower price (for the same travel days) and was ready to take payment on phone and do the reservation. I told him I will call in ten minutes since I did not have my card ready. After 10 minutes another lady answered and quoted me a fare £200 higher. When I mentioned that I had been quoted a different fare just a few minutes before and wanted to speak to the guy, she said she did not know where he was. I rang first thing the following day and another lady did the booking by phone within a few minutes at a much lower fare without haggling. The issue of fax machine did not arise, and I wondered if each person on shift had their own rules.

The point of taking this route was to get to Johannesburg before noon on Saturday 9th in order to attend to other commitments there. Kenya Airways seemed the most convenient for our requirements, there was a two hour plus gap between the scheduled arrival time of KQ513 and the departure time of KQ760 - so none of us could have imagined the nightmare that awaited us at the Kenya Airways hub in Nairobi!  Due to a 2hour 15 minute (or longer) delay of the departure of KQ513 from Dakar, we barely made it on time for our connecting flight. There was no ground staff available to assist us get to the connecting flight. The ground staff at the gate were quick to gleefully tell us that we had been off-loaded from flight KQ760 to Johannesburg.  They were there to block not to facilitate passengers. Following desperate pleas, they decided to board the business class passengers and not economy class - thus separating my colleague and I. When I pleaded on my colleague's behalf I was told that not enough meals were loaded into the economy class cabin! If passengers are late due to a Kenyan Airways delay (and no fault of their own) ground staff should meet the passengers and escort them to the connecting flight if it is still on the ground. In the event that the flight is over-booked tell passengers the truth than use an excuse as pathetic as the one that was given by ground staff. ",29th December 2017
195,"✅ Trip Verified |  Johannesburg to Addis Ababa via Nairobi. Upon arrival in Addis Ababa, I collected my suitcase - only to find that it had been terribly damaged. What’s more is that I paid extra to have the bag wrapped in South Africa. I immediately went to the baggage help desk, where I was given a reference number and told that I would be contacted. For the entire stay in Ethiopia, I was not contacted by Kenya Airways. When I returned to South Africa, I emailed the airline asking for an update. I was referred to someone else and have still not been helped! Truly disappointed in this bad service.",27th December 2017
196,"✅ Trip Verified | Average to very poor experience. They lost my baggage and still have not provided any update or response to my several enquiries to date. I was on their flight from Dakar to Lusaka (and later to Heathrow and back to Dakar). I flew out on 4th November, arrived in Lusaka on the 5th. The bag did not arrive. I made a formal report immediately at the airport. I had to follow up severally with them. No one ever got in touch with me to give any feedback. On my way to Nairobi (and in Nairobi) I was able to get hold of a representative. I was asked to fill a claim form on the 11th of November and assured that they will get back to me within 28 days. I did everything they asked me to do. I heard nothing back from them - not at any point. I called today (12th of December) and was told my file had been ""closed"" and it is assumed the matter was resolved. I have asked that I need a resolution. I have not experienced such poor service anywhere. Never fly them if you have an alternative.",13th December 2017

198,"✅ Trip Verified |  Dar Es salaam to Bangkok via Nairobi. I had the worst experience with Kenya Airways. My flight got canceled for 7hrs, they provided us with accommodation in Nairobi. However, one of the staff at the airport in Nairobi told me Kenya Airways isn’t responsible for my ticket from Bangkok to Phuket  because it was domestic flight I was meant to use Thai Airways ). It was their fault that my ticket from Bangkok to Phuket went to waste yet they told me I have to pay for my own expenses.  I am more than disappointed with this flight. I won’t recommend to use it if you have a connecting flight from Nairobi. They do not take responsibility when it comes to such big matters. ",7th December 2017
199,"✅ Verified Review |  Mumbai to Khartoum via Nairobi. Kenya Airways is not bad. Flights are in time, but found some cabin crew not fully experienced. Food and beverages are acceptable.

200,"✅ Verified Review |  Nairobi to Amsterdam. The announcement about boarding times were clear during the waiting period. Boarding gates opened early enough. It was easy to locate the gates as the airport is clearly marked and well lit. The Boeing B787-8 is new, even though the seat i had was somehow uncomfortable but with adequate leg room nevertheless. The cabin crew were quite welcoming and wore a welcoming smile. The aircraft left on time. Once airborne we were served snacks, then a tasty meal followed including options of drinks, no sooner had we settled for a nab another round of snacks came along, then a meal. It was an endless supply of food by an efficient cabin crew. We landed at Amsterdam on time.  I recommend this airline.",17th October 2017
201,"✅ Verified Review |  Dar es Salaam to Bangkok via Nairobi. It is obvious why this airline is in deep financial trouble. None of the payment methods on their website work - we tried several different credit cards from different banks from accounts in different countries (including East Africa) and none of them worked. Flights need to be paid for (with an additional fee - they will not waive it even though their website has payment issues) over the phone or through third-party websites. We needed to change our business class tickets to the next day due to unforseeable changes. Although their website says you can do this online, you can't. Again, it wouldn't take any payment method even when we did a 3 way call between our banks and the airline. Their solution was to write an email to their tech department. All of the flight options the website showed were different from what the Kenya Airways representative could see on their end. All of the flight options the representative could see were hundreds of dollars more than what was being shown to us on their website. After several hours (12pm until 7pm) and dropped calls later, they finally booked us a ticket that ended up costing us significantly more and we ended up losing our business class seats. We couldn't pay over the phone and so we were told we could pay at the airport at no extra charge. Upon reaching the airport, the ticketing agent charged us even more than the price on the emailed ticked we had. She refused to call the manager and told us we could either pay the extra money or not get on the flight. Once finally reaching our destination, we tried reaching out to Kenya Airways several times to share our poor experience, hoping they would do something about it to avoid losing our business in the future as we fly into East Africa often to vist family & friends. Instead, we were met with a generic email replies telling us they were ""looking into the situation."" This airline and their customer service is a disappointment. Unfortunately they have a monopoly over the East African region, offering the only choice to fly between major cities. If you are flying into the area from outside of East Africa, there are plenty of other airlines based in the middle east, South Africa, and other continents which are far more reputable.",11th October 2017
202,"✅ Verified Review |  Zanzibar to Johannesburg via Nairobi, we were told that due to overbooking, we must take a later flight about 4 hours. They always overbook a flight so we were the unlucky ones who have to take a flight four hours later, with zero consideration for the inconvenience caused. There will be no compensation as they booked us on SAA (this again was our fault). We insisted on lunch, which was a burger only because Kenyan Airways policy does not buy sides. We were informed our luggage was on the SAA flight, after 30 minutes of waiting we realised that our luggage has not arrived with us. After numerous queries we managed to locate our luggage (Thanks to helpful staff at OR Tambo). As the lady at the counter said that we must actually be thankful that our luggage has arrived. The staff at Kenyan Airways was unhelpful and made as though everything was our fault. I will never fly Kenya Airways again.",4th October 2017
203,"✅ Verified Review |  London to Dar es Salaam via Nairobi. Heathrow to Nairobi was full, had an aisle seat, but cushion was well worn. Evening meal served by efficient cabin crew. Meal and breakfast was better than on some better known airlines. Nairobi to Dar es Salaam on Embraer 190 was a pleasant flight, comfortable leather seats and another breakfast. Flight was on time. Return flight from Dar es Salaam scheduled for 3.45 am which was a bit inconvenient, but get to the departure gate in good time - this flight left 15 minutes early as all passengers had boarded. Aircraft was clean, breakfast was served. Cabin crew efficient. At Nairobi there is a scheduled 4 hour wait for the flight to Heathrow. Again aircraft was on time and nearly full. Yet another breakfast, this time a full meal with three choices - omelette, sausage or vegetarian. Cabin crew efficient and worked smoothly and without fuss. Had an aisle seat next to the exit door, plenty of legroom and a comfortable flight. Maybe they could have done a couple of water runs as it is a long flight. Arrived on time but had to stack as airport was busy. I have used Kenya Airways before this year. They are worth considering and are a cut above some of the UK competitors in terms of food and comfort.",27th September 2017
204,"✅ Verified Review |  Dar es Salaam to Mahe via Nairobi at a very reasonable price. I was surprised (and a little nervous) that my connection in Nairobi was only 50 minutes - what could possibly go wrong? - but on the day, everything went like clockwork. The first flight was in an Embraer, very comfortable and even had USB ports. Nice light breakfast served. Magnificent views of Kilimanjaro on this route (left side, but I imagine this could vary). Departed and arrived on time, found my new gate relatively easily and with plenty of time to explore the severely overpriced airport food outlets. Not that I needed to eat, the next flight provided lunch which was tasty. Full selection of movies on this flight also. All round, an excellent experience.",27th September 2017
205,"✅ Verified Review |  London to Nairobi. The aircraft was a fairly new Boeing 787. I cannot fault the crew, aircraft cleanliness, seat comfort and pitch all were fine on an Economy Cabin flight.  My onboard entertainment system did not function on either the outbound or inbound flights on the London Nairobi flights. the sound accompanying films was inaudible on both the airline provided headsets and my noise cancelling headphones. This is a problem experienced by at least 30 passengers on each flight. And anecdotally according to another passenger a common problem on their flights.",6th September 2017
206,"✅ Verified Review |  Nairobi to Paris. We were in the lounge when an announcement was made the flight was delayed. The next thing we knew we were called to ""final boarding"". Arrived at the gate to confusion. Once we were boarded the confusion continued. Lots of chatting among staff at the doors for about 20 minutes. During that time there was no attempt to serve the business class passengers. It was a long flight. No water bottles provided which is fine because we like to try and keep things environmentally friendly but also had to ask repeatedly for glasses of water. Had to help ourselves to pillows and blankets from a bin. They ran out of 2 of the 3 choices of breakfast by row 4 in business class. The USB charger in my seat didn't work. My headphones made a loud screeching noise if I turned my head. My seat wouldn't fully recline. During take off and landing our attendant kicked off her shoes and slept. She was probably the only one on the flight that did catch a comfortable sleep. We've flown business class often and if we ever are forced to fly Kenya Air again, we'll choose economy class because it felt like that anyway.",4th September 2017

The aircraft seem to be in reasonable condition and the crew also seem OK, the problem is the rest of it. Prices are high.

When we were checking in just now for our flight back to Guangzhou, we confirmed our destination with the staff, but they still gave us boarding passes which said from Nairobi to Bangkok. But for my asking the airline desk later when we got into the waiting area, we wouldn't even know that we still need boarding passes from Bangkok to Guangzhou and things would be even more troublesome if I hadn't asked. Never seen a via flight that requires 2 boarding passes for a person, each for a sector of the flight! When we flew from Guangzhou to Nairobi, it was only one boarding pass per person. More bizarrely, we are placed in different seats these two sectors, which means we will still have to change seats when we arrive in Bangkok! Moreover, flight service is mediocre. Avoid at all cost.",21st July 2017

The flight was ok just the cabin crew were unfriendly and unapproachable. The second flight was from Nairobi to Bangkok and experienced the same issues with the cabin crew except this time after pressing for assistance as they missed us for documentation that needed filling they never came so I pressed for assistance again and no one came - so clicked it again and a flight attendant came storming down the isle and yelled at us to the point where we could not speak because she was busy telling us off for clicking the button more then once. Two horrible encounters with Kenya Airways and would not recommend this airline.,21st July 2017
210,✅ Verified Review |  Took a flight from Johannesburg to London (via Nairobi) and a return from Amsterdam to Johannesburg (via Nairobi).

FA's were great on both routes. On the outbound flight before we left the terminal we were served water and soda and towels. Snacks served as soon as the seat belt were off and lunch not long after. The FA's were very busy the whole flight, approx. 3.30 hrs. Return was much the same. Food was average airline but edible. Entertainment not fantastic but suitable for this flight.

212,"✅ Verified Review |  Hanoi to Johannesburg via Nairobi. We had the misfortune of experiencing 'the pride of Africa' on our honeymoon to Vietnam in April 2017. Our negative and unpleasant experience with Kenya Airways culminated in the loss of my wife's luggage upon arrival in Johannesburg. After numerous phone calls and emails, absolutely nothing was done to locate this luggage and eventually the airline merely admitted that it was untraceable. None of our calls were ever returned, we received differing stories of the bag not being loaded first in Hanoi and then in Nairobi. It became quite obvious from the outset that the airline did not care about this problem and could not be bothered to help us. The flight experience was unprofessional, tardy, and disrespectful towards the passengers. Traveling between Hanoi and Nairobi felt like the passengers were alone on the flight and when the air hostess staff were visible, they were sullen, impatient and obviously cared very little for the wellbeing and comfort of the passengers on board. Upon boarding the flight in Hanoi, we were not greeted by a single staff member. Passengers were sleeping in incorrect seats and no air hostess could be found to assist us. Food was served with an air of contempt and annoyance. The hot breakfast consisted of a stale croissant and fruit. Drinks were served once on the flight. Trays took more than an hour to be cleared. An all round ghastly experience hopefully not to ever be repeated. We arrived home from an amazing honeymoon with a bitter taste in our mouths and one less bag. Stay away - not worth the lower cost at all.",30th April 2017

I could check my baggage all the way through to Zurich and received all boarding Passes even as I switched from Skyteam to Star Alliance. The whole check in procedure took only 5 minutes. The flight was very good, with comfortable seats, good food and great red wine. Staff was super friendly",29th April 2017

215,"✅ Verified Review |  Johannesburg to Mombasa via Nairobi. Due to technical issues with the original airline, we were rebooked on Kenya Airways. Boeing 787 was in in mint condition. Warmly welcomed by the purser and shown to our seats. The business class is called Premium World and seats in a 2-2-2 configuration with fully reclining seats. Offered a welcome drink and introduced to staff who would look after us personally. Warm towels followed by a review of the menu and wine list by the stewardess. Flight left on time and was smooth. Seat was comfortable and I managed a good hour nap laying flat. Luncheon included an amuse bouche, followed by a salad and two options for main. I opted for the steak which was slightly over done but still yummy. My fellow traveller tasted the wines and he loved the selection of South African wines. The service was personal, friendly and warm. Not too much or too fawning. The Kenyan coffee was a lovely surprise! My one complaint is that the in flight entertainment isn't up to the level of Emirates but I have encountered few airlines that have matched that. Landing on time and we had priority lane through immigration. Shorter flight was on an Embraer E190. First time flying this aircraft and what a little delight! Similar warm service with good humour. Definitely recommend.",19th April 2017
216,"✅ Verified Review |  Despite a 2.5hour delay due to technical issues, the flight went on fine. A wide variety of food options were available, and the food was average. Seats were comfortable with excellent recline, and large (comfy) blankets are provided for sleeping. The bathroom at the front of the aircraft is quite small and cramped, offering no additional features compared to the bathrooms in Economy; in fact, the bathrooms in Economy are more spacious. Cabin lights are practically turned off overnight, allowing for a good night's sleep. There is a TV screen, tray table and power socket in the armrest. TV screen is nice and large. Noise cancelling headphones are provided, I found them rather comfortable and I have a fairly large head and wear glasses. The selection of inflight TV programs is average. Passengers in Business class are treated fairly well. An amenity kit is given (which contains a toothbrush, socks, a pen, a comb, and an eye mask) which is nice. Hot towels are provided at certain points during the flight including upon boarding. The lounge at Nairobi is also quite good. Kenya Airways has a very nice layout of the Airport for Business Class passengers, I had no queues, a very smooth process. Overall, a nice experience. Would've been excellent if technical issues were diagnosed before the flight to avoid delays; and I do hope KQ improves its on-time performance.",16th April 2017
217,"✅ Verified Review |  My Kenya Airways flight from Nairobi to Paris (a codeshare with Air France) was delayed and eventually left 14 h after the scheduled time. We had to queue for almost an hour at 1.30 am to get a voucher for a taxi as they were all written by hand and we were not given a hotel voucher, just told to go to a hotel (which very kindly took us in based on our word that our flight was delayed). We did not collect our luggage. We were told by KQ staff at the airport that we would be collected at 11 am the following day. The next morning I looked at my booking on the internet to see that the plane was scheduled to leave at 11 am. I took a taxi to the airport from the city and when I checked in I was told that the plane was leaving at 11 am. I got the same message at the boarding gate where they were getting ready to accept passengers. The airport staff seemed not to be aware that there were 200+ passengers in hotels in Nairobi. We had to wait for them to arrive. We were then told to go to gate 13 but the plane was at gate 14. We left 14 hours late. Kenya Airways staff made no public announcements during the whole of this shambles, and no apology was given until we heard from the pilot that passengers had to be collected from Nairobi. The staff at the gate seemed leaderless and unable to communicate with the many anxious passengers who had missed their connecting flights and would not arrive in Paris until 9 pm, too late to get anywhere. I had to pay for a hotel in Paris and then continue my journey by train the next day.",13th April 2017

219,"✅ Verified Review |  Flew the day flight Kenya Airways from Nairobi to Amsterdam in the new Boeing 787 and I am really not impressed. The 787 is certainly an improvement in comfort and reduce negative effects of flying, but the Business Class of Kenya Airways is just no match for the price, which is 40% more than competition. All in the service is just behind. Lie flat seat is ok but already look old after couple of years, and the conception is already ancient (manual handset with a wire). Service is just too basic for the price you pay, and the staff is pretty cold, un-attentive and seem bored every time you ask something (not all of them, there are couple of pursers really doing it right, but the rest is awful). I am not asking much as flying is a commodity but a minimum of politeness when coughing up 5,000 USD for a 7h flight is a fare expectations, as the level of service is nowhere representative of that. Premium Economy in some European carriers is actually better service for 1/3 of the fare. Meal service is quite basic, you get the plates and in 5 min they are taken out. The cabin is ok but already looks old. Nothing like you should expect in light of the fares charged on this route, and the contrast with KLM is just obvious",26th March 2017

I was taking a school group to Africa and originally was trying to fly Ethiopian or Qatar, but both were booked out so we went with Kenya Airways. We were met at Suvarnabhumi Airport by an agent of the airline as we were a group and check-in was very smooth. Their Boeing 787 seems to have more pitch than others I have flown and so was much more comfortable for me with longer legs on an overnight flight. Flight crew to Nairobi were all African (I specify this as the Nairobi to Bangkok return flight they were all Asian as the flight continues to Hong Kong) and were very professional and provided good service. As the flight originated in China, most passengers on board when we boarded were Chinese and so were typically noisy during the flight, but no more than I have gotten used to! Food was good and served punctually. I even slept a bit during the flight - unusual for me! Overall I recommend them as a cheaper flight to Africa.",14th March 2017
221,"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Nairobi. The inbound aircraft from Nairobi was late into Heathrow, we had to briefly go back to the gate with a maintenance issue. One of my reading lights didn't work but these things happen with airlines. The crew was great, the cabin was spotless and meal delicious. They held the connecting flight to Mombasa for me, something that airlines promise but rarely do. That flight had a newish aircraft, charming crew and clear flight deck announcements. They served a warm breakfast, not bad for a 45 minute flight. KQ were equally good on a flight to London a couple of years ago after I slipped a disc and had to be taken home in a wheelchair. I was looked after perfectly until I reached Heathrow. My only criticism is the fault of Kenya Airports Authority. It is unbelievable in the 21st century that to get to JKIA's domestic terminal, you have to push your heavy luggage cart across an enormous car park with kerbs, busy traffic and dubious individuals who want to relieve you of your luggage temporarily - or perhaps permanently. There is no reason not to have a level, paved, lit, signposted pathway - after all if Kenya can get Chinese contractors to finish a brand new railway line between Mombasa and Nairobi with gleaming new stations and viaducts six months early, they can't prevail on the Chinese to build a simple path in a week - if the work is too onerous to do themselves, that is. Or would that deprive freelance porters of income? The car park trek is a huge disincentive to use KQ to domestic destinations in Kenya - it's easier, but not such a pleasant experience, to use Turkish or Ethiopian which fly direct and clear customs at your destination.",10th March 2017
222,"✅ Verified Review |  Nairobi to Mt Kilimanjaro. We arrived in Nairobi with some lateness from our BA flight and had to transfer to our Kenya Airways flight to Mt Kilimanjaro. Since our luggage was not checked through we were told we should proceed to immigration collect our luggage then check into our Kenya Airways flight. The minute we arrived with lateness we asked some official in the airport where to go. They pointed us towards the connections area up some stairway. We proceeded to the Kenya Airways desk, the staff were a bit clueless as to what to do until we were told to go to another desk, who in turn told us to talk to BA. After bouncing around a few desks (running) we knew we were not going to make our flight and our luggage would be left in the collection belt. We decided to miss the flight and try for a later one. The Kenya Airways staff were absolutely unhelpful. When trying to purchase the tickets we were sent to another desk, guess what, they don't take cards. And the tickets were 320$ each. At this desk we were finally told the only way to sort this was to go through immigration, collect our luggage, go to the other terminal to another Kenya Airways desk, buy our tickets then check in. In my lifetime of travelling, this was one of the most gruelling and awful experiences I have ever had. After collecting our luggage and walking outside being accosted by random ""officials"" trying to make a quick buck and people trying to scam us we made our way to the Kenya Airways office. They then offered us a pair of tickets which were now $420 each, apparently our no show on the flight we missed incurred a fee. They were taking advantage of the situation despite none of this being our fault, and only due to their incompetence. We had no choice but to buy the tickets and move on. We checked in and made the flight, which was going via Zanzibar which finally got us to Mt Kilimanjaro at 3am. It is an awful airport, countless security checks, unhelpful and incompetent staff. Never again.",2nd March 2017

That flight was delayed and I had a very short time for international transfer at OR Tambo. Not surprisingly, my luggage, which had been checked to Johannesburg was left behind. I barely made it through check-in in time for my flight KQ761 to JKIA. The support I received from KQ staff was amazing starting at OR Tambo KQ counter, I was whisked through check-in and I made it for my flight, then a staff member picked up my issue with left luggage and personally ensured that it was not only loaded on the next flight but I was sent a confirmation via WhatsApp. On reporting the left luggage at the JKIA complaints desk, another staff member was very helpful and logged the complaint calling to inform me that the luggage had been received in Nairobi. There were many others who pointed me in the right direction to ensure that I got back my bag intact and without any drama. The entire crew on board KQ761 from OR Tambo to JKIA on Feb 12, 2017 provided an excellent cabin service and a smooth ride.",14th February 2017

225,✅ Verified Review |  This has to be one of the worst travel experiences ever. I would never recommend Kenya Airways. They changed our departure date by 1 day from Maputo to Amsterdam (via Nairobi) without even advising us. This meant I had to change my ongoing flights to Toulouse and Belfast as I had booked and paid EasyJet for these. Kenya Airways refuse to reimburse me the cost of changing the tickets. Then when we went to check in at Maputo Airport and were told that our tickets had been cancelled and we were not on the flight. That was a very stressful 30 minutes. Finally they advised us that we could check in. The Boeing 787 from Amsterdam to Nairobi was terrible. Poor choice of movies. Very cramped. Terrible cold breakfast. Tasteless dinner. The only enjoyable bit about the whole experience was the flight from Nairobi to Amsterdam that was operated by KLM. Even Nairobi Airport is a terrible place. Poor choice of restaurants. No airconditioning and no wireless. Never again. ,24th January 2017
226,"✅ Verified Review |  Johannesburg to Bangkok via Nairobi. Terrible airline - do not book Kenya Airways! We originally booked our Johannesburg to Bangkok tickets via Nairobi because of the short travelling time - there was only a 1-1.5 hour layover in Nairobi each way. Months after booking the ticket, Kenya Airways rescheduled our flights so that there was a 7 hour layover in Nairobi. The 7 hour layover ended up 5 hours longer than expected because the flight to Bangkok was severely delayed (this after our flight to Nairobi had been delayed by 2 hours and used a different aircraft that did not have in flight entertainment). The 5 hour delay severely impacted our plans in Thailand, creating great inconvenience and forcing us to make additional travel arrangement to the island we were staying on, at our own expense. When we raised these concerns with the Kenya Airways service desk at Nairobi airport, we were told that they could not assist us and we had to log a complaint with Kenya Airways customer service. My partner logged a complaint - we have still had no reply to this. We faced the same experience on our return flights - the flight from Bangkok to Nairobi was delayed by 3 hours which meant we missed our connecting flight to Johannesburg and were put on the next flight out - another 7 hour wait at Nairobi airport. Then we were notified that we had been moved to a later flight that evening because a smaller aircraft had to be used. When we eventually arrived back in Johannesburg, my partner's bag had been left in Nairobi. The agent at the Kenya Airways luggage desk told us it would be couriered to us the next morning - it was only delivered at 10pm the next night. Our flights with Kenya Airways ended up being the worst travel experience of any airline - we ended up spending over 20 hours extra at Nairobi airport as well as 5 hours extra at Johannesburg and Bangkok airports due to KQ delays - an entire day of our holiday lost due to their inefficiencies. None of the customer service complaints we have logged have been replied to. We will never fly Kenya Airways again.",23rd January 2017

When finally boarding the attendant informed us that this flight doesn't go to Bujumbura anymore but to Kigali. Nobody informed us of the change (despite our visit to the helpdesk to ask information about food and drink voucher which was not given). Calling the operation manager, we have been told that the decision has been made a few hours before our boarding time.  Needless to say, we were not given any compensation whatsoever.

Flights were as expected (pretty basic economy class) with a 12 hour overnight wait for connection in Nairobi on the return leg which was awful. It was cheap but I would never fly with Kenya Airways again due to their terrible customer service. My fiance left an item (not on display) in the seat pocket in front of her. She realised as soon as she left the plane and staff on board were contacted within 30 minutes of us getting into the terminal. The item had mysteriously disappeared during cleaning. I followed up with their customer service by phone (said they would investigate but never called me back) and then by email. I know it was our fault for leaving the item but I would have expected them to at least be helpful in dealing with our enquiry or show some sympathy or some kind of apology. Instead they said that there was no evidence that I brought the item onboard therefore they could not do anything to help, no form that I could fill in for lost items, no documentation for an insurance claim, just a short, rude reply from their customer services which made me think that this was not the first time that this had happened and that I should make other potential Kenya Airways customers aware of this - if you leave something of value on the plane in Nairobi, don't expect to get it back.",17th January 2017

The initial Kenya Airways flight from Lusaka to Nairobi was delayed, and I was told that the connecting flight would be delayed by 2 hours which ensured connection time for the connecting flight. Upon arriving in Nairobi I was informed that the connecting flight KQ886 would not depart Nairobi at 02:00am, but  it would depart at 09:00am. Again this KQ886 flight has been delayed, I am now told that this flight will not be available for 4 days and I will have to wait in Nairobi. I am now informed by the airline customer service personnel that the flight will depart on December 30th at 11:59pm. At this point I have no idea if I will be on this flight, if this flight even exists. I am so upset by the poor service and rude customer service personnel. To make matters worse I have other travel arrangements and bookings that have to be rescheduled, some of which are non-refundable, ground transportation changes to be made and no idea at all from Kenya Airways management and customer service personnel when I will arrive at my destination. I have spoked to several customer service personnel and airline supervisors and managers, all of which provide different excuses for the airlines disfunctionality and various excuses as to why the flight is delayed and when it will be rescheduled. What a terrible, terrible experience. I cannot believe that there is such disfunctionality with in this international airline, the lack of customer support and the over all disrespect for its customers.",30th December 2016
230,"✅ Verified Review |  Johannesburg to Zanzibar via Nairobi. Worst airline that I have encountered. Flight from Johannesburg to Nairobi delayed by 1.5 hours. We ended up flying at 3am. No drinks were offered prior to the descent which was at about 8 am. About 20 of us missed our connecting flight to Zanzibar, because only 1 hour had been allowed between flights. Others missed flights to Kilimanjaro. Kenya Airways provided a hotel in a terrible area for our 10 hour layover. There was nothing to do near the hotel and most of us missed a full day at expensive resort accommodation in Zanzibar. We would only reach our hotels at around 10 pm.",19th December 2016
231,"✅ Verified Review |  Johannesburg to Bangkok via Nairobi. Terrible Experience with Kenya Airways losing my baggage and not being able to assist in any way to track the baggage.

232,"Four short flight with Kenya Airways, two on time and two delayed by 45 odd minutes. All fairly comfortable, notably the E190. Poor breakfast on the ""red eye"" from Lilongwe to Nairobi, small snack on the 40 minute leg to and from Mombasa, and reasonable lunch with wine on the return to Lilongwe from Nairobi. Ground staff and flight crew were reasonable efficient and friendly, given the short flights. Award flights, so good value.",21st November 2016
233,"Johannesburg to Antananarivo via Nairobi with Kenya Airways. Generally positive experience with KQ on 4 sectors. Dreamliner is excellent and the E190 also has personal TV screens (one sector they were not functional). Food sometimes excellent (chicken and beef), sometimes really bad (fish and vegetarian). Cabin crew consistently excellent, and beverage services generous. KQ offers 2 x 23kg bags to Madagascar (unlike all their competitors flying the route) but the KQ agents admitted the smaller planes that use the route (E190) cannot cope with the loads when the flight is full (which ours were) which resulted in ours and many others bags not making it from NBO - although it followed the following day. We were disappointed that they were not able to deliver to our hotel we had to return back to the airport and wait for hours for the bags to be released. Last flight NBO - JNB involved flying through an electrical storm for a full 30 minutes in the middle of the night. The crew handled it brilliantly.",31st October 2016
234,"Amsterdam to Lilongwe via Nairobi. Boarding was smooth, with the gate open for nearly an hour and manned by KLM staff. The extra leg room seat was fairly comfortable but narrow. Drinks and a pretty minimal meal were served by friendly crew. I slept through breakfast, but missed little, as it really was small. Departure on time and arrival early. Flight was full, The second shorter flight to Lilongwe was in an E190, and was more pleasant with a cooked breakfast and more space.",5th October 2016
235,"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Lusaka via Nairobi with Kenya Airways. Outward Boeing 787, full aircraft, seats narrow and not much room to move, particularly in terms of width. On time departure, cabin clean and cabin attendants efficient. Food was average with a choice. Landed on time at Nairobi, then off again to Lusaka, again on time, Embraer 190. Leather seats, but seen some wear. Plane fairly full, snack served on short flight. Return flight from Lusaka - this time via Harare to pick up more passengers - had to stay on the plane (Embraer 190) while cabin was cleaned. Return flight was late, as was departure from Harare back to Nairobi but enough time to connect with Boeing 787 to London. Again food was average, Cabin crew were OK but rather expressionless. Dreamliner is not a comfortable plane and the tinted windows were irritating, as the centre seats were virtually dark when window passengers used the dark tint and I could hardly see my food. Although a newish aircraft, seat pocket was torn and plane looked grubby. Arrival at Heathrow was a little late. Overall impression was satisfactory in that this type of airline does its best to survive amongst the bigger ones.",5th October 2016
236,"✅ Verified Review |  Djibouti to Zanzibar via Niarobi. Some friends and I decided to take a short trip to Zanzibar over an extended weekend for about four days. Unfortunately, more than 1/3 of our trip ended up being spent in transit. I am thoroughly disappointed by the lack of professionalism and competence repeatedly displayed by the Kenya Airway agents in the Nairobi airport. The first flight to Nairobi was more than an hour late. When we arrived in Nairobi we immediately went to the Kenyan Airways counter, knowing we had missed our connection. The attendant at the counter told us there were not any other flights that would get us into Zanzibar that day and the only one available left close to midnight and we would arrive the next morning. This was a lie. We waited a bit and went to another desk and the person there found a flight leaving that evening and though we still spent more than 12 hours in the airport, it would get us into Zanzibar about 11 p.m. When leaving the airport from Zanzibar on the return flight Sept 4 the personnel at the counter (Precision Air) would not print both our boarding passes, they told us we had to get them at the desk in Nairobi. We had a 1 hr and 15 min layover and immediately went to the desk to get our tickets. Of course the queue was very long and half the customers ignored it and walked right up to the desk - which the Kenya Airline employees did not seem to care about. When the first of our group arrived at the desk we still had just over 30 minutes before our flight left. We had already spent 30 minutes in line because of the horrible time management and inefficiency of the staff. When we arrived at the desk the gentleman told us we missed our flight. Again, we still had 30 minutes to get to the flight and should have already been checked in when we checked in at the Zanzibar airport. They then told us even if we were first in line at the desk when the plane landed (an hour before takeoff) we still would not have been able to board the plane. Why not? Why would they sell us a ticket on Kenya Airways own website that was a fraud? The entire time we are talking with the desk people they are again, randomly talking to other customers who just walked up (like the outraged lady who was supposed to being going to one location but the Kenya Airways attendants booked her to the wrong country - I didn't really blame her), checking their phones, and essentially being some of the most atrocious customer service representatives imaginable. They were flippant and did not care. To make the long story shorter, we were stuck in the airport until after midnight before we were moved to a hotel then returned the next morning for an afternoon flight - which was of course delayed a couple times. The flight attendants were wonderful though none of the entertainment systems worked on the flight. I would not recommend this airline unless you literally had no other options.",22nd September 2016
237,Nairobi to Kisumu and Nairobi to Mombasa with Kenya Airways. The airline does have it share of constant emails with changes to the flight schedule very frequent. The check in process (I am a Sky Priority Elite member) is smooth and the staff were very good on the Nairobi-Kisumu and Nairobi-Mombasa round trips. The staff on the flights are excellent. The flight attendants are very well dressed and presented (this is my 20th round trip domestically with the company). They even manage to serve a snack (samosa) and a drink for a 45 minute flight. However the arrival at the domestic terimal in Nairobi is dated by 20+ years. The baggage delivery area is very outdated. The arrival area outside is old and not very accomodating.,12th September 2016
238,"✅ Verified Review |  Nairobi to London. We were held to ransom by Kenyan Airways staff at the boarding gate about to get on a flight to London from Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. We had a fully paid and confirmed ticket for the flight we were prevented from boarding. Boarding staff demanded we pay a disputed amount for a flight we had taken with a partner airline a week earlier, or else they would not let us board, nor would they put us on another flight. They would in effect strand us in Nairobi. We had to pay an extra $720 which we are now trying to claim back. It was extortion no matter what way you look at it. Go to Kenya but avoid Kenyan Airways at all costs.",8th September 2016

They promised connection hotel with shuttle, but the shuttle was broken. They refused to pay for taxi and water or food for the people left in the airport lobby. They told us to wait outside in the night for 5 hours and yelled at us for no patience. Next day they did not arrange the departure flight, not to mention the connection flight. ",29th August 2016

Great services and on time departures all times.",26th August 2016

While booking the tickets it had already been stated that the flight is often delayed by 30 minutes, but had not expected the number to rise so horribly. After 2 hours 30 minutes the flight arrived. The cabin crew do not have a welcoming nature. They served the food 3 hours 30 minutes after takeoff where other airlines start serving much sooner. This journey made me more tired and I will never choose Kenya Airways in the future.",25th August 2016

Very spacious and comfortable, good food and drink, good entertainment to make the trip bearable and very friendly crew on-board.

244,"✅ Verified Review |  On the Nairobi-Mumbai route, Kenya Airways uses a B737-800. Their logo mentions ""The Pride of Africa"" but there is not much to be proud about that flight: miserable breakfast (poached eggs are just warm hard-boiled eggs, no yoghourt offered, tasteless fruit, bad coffee). Seats are antiquated and hardly recline, on the VDO, games were blocked. Fortunately, the crew is very attentive and very pleasant. Choice of reading materials is very limited. Upon arrival in Mumbai, my luggage was missing. It was probably mishandled in Nairobi, though we had 2 hours transit time, but no compensation was offered as on other airlines, not even some amenities for the night, just a few nice words and the promise it wold come on the next day, wait and see. Despite the problems, I would still recommend the airline, as connection times are generally good and their 787s are very nice.",19th June 2016
245,"Very impressed with the service offered on these flights. We had missed our booked flight (ET direct from Djibouti to Addis Ababa) so re-booked at the last minute onto Kenya Airways. Even at this late stage, the fare was good and we departed a few hours later than originally planned. The aircraft was clean with comfortable seats (much better than ET on similar routes) and drinks and a small meal were served. All of excellent quality. On the first sector, the crew was headed up by a Purser who was excellent in his customer service and clear announcements in both French and English. The crew had a good sense of humour and were ready to assist in whatever way they could. Transit was via the new airport terminal in Nairobi. One word: Wow! This terminal is exceptional and must be the easiest to navigate, most comfortable I have experienced on the continent. It beats JNB, CPT and others hands-down. Processing was swift and comfortable, shops were open as were a selection of restaurants. There is clearly more to come from this airport as a number of shops seem to be preparing to open. Gate rooms are open and comfortable with access to bathrooms nearby. Fantastic new airport! Our onward flight to Addis was also good. We had to wait for a large party of late passengers but the crew were thoughtful enough to offer us a glass of water or orange juice while we awaited the late-comers. Much appreciated. Another light meal (breakfast) and drinks were served during the flight. Seats were comfortable and I slept well. Excellent job by both crews and Kenya Airways.",14th June 2016
246,"✅ Verified Review |  Nairobi to Gaborone return. Kenya Airways and their cost cutting measures are really showing inflight and in their flagship Lounge at NBO. Onboard what used to be a 4 course dinner service is now 3 courses, with a very mediocre salad starter, choice of 3 mains but all over cooked and tasteless, and then a mousse like dessert. No fruit, no cheese and no red wine. Ran out of champagne half way through the flight. The business class seats on Embraer 190 have no leg rest, and very poor recline. No amenity kit, so no eye mask to keep out the blaring cabin lights, or ear plugs to drown out the sound of the cabin crew. Really wish they would return to their glorious days when one would be proud to fly KQ.",20th May 2016
247,"I was supposed to fly Kenya Airways out of Nairobi to Entebbe at 3.30 pm. I get to the airport at 1pm and am told that my flight is overbooked and I will fly out at 7.45 pm. In this way I would have missed an extremely important event in Kampala. I asked why I wasn't informed before and no one explained. The ground staff was extremely rude, no sorry, no explanation, not half a smile, no one could care less and they never bothered to send me an email or inform me. I asked for some sort of compensation and was denied until after complaining for 3 hours straight (when I received 50 dollars out of my 180$ ticket). I asked to talk to a manager and was sent to 4 different offices where no one could give me any sort of information. No wifi was available but when I asked for crew to hotspot me everyone refused so I had no way of contacting people in Kampala. It was the worst customer service experiences I have had. I finally go to board my 7.45pm flight only to discover it has been delayed by one hour.",29th March 2016

249,"I have flown with Kenya Airways before and would describe them as being cheap and cheerful with slightly above average service. Flights to Johannesburg were on time however they ran out of meal choices and we were left with a rather disgusting fish affair. I had chosen Kenya Airways primarily because of their generous baggage allowance ie 2 x 23kg bags as we were bringing sports equipment and motorcycle gear on our holiday. All went reasonably well even given the poor meals on the outbound flight however coming back was a different matter. When we arrived at Johannesburg Airport we were faced with a huge set of scales placed in front of the check in counter that also had its own usual scales. We had to have our bags weighed and the very over officious clerk refused to take my bags as one was 3kg overweight never mind the fact that my other bag was 4kg under weight. I would have understood the concerns if the total of my bags were overweight but they weren't and despite my appeals for a more common sense approach and despite my bags being identically packed to the outward journey (where they were checked in at Heathrow with no problem) I had to repack my luggage on the check in floor. This in my view is a totally ridiculous rule that appears to only be applied at Johannesburg (I have flown Kenya Airways from London, Mombasa and Nairobi on several occasions without any inconvenience). On the flight to Nairobi they again ran out of food choices and we were served by a very rude steward who just slammed the food if you can call it that down in front of us. When we arrived in Nairobi they were bussing those ending their journey there to the terminal but there were no directions for those transitting, we managed to find an emergency exit and took that and were lucky to find a very impatient Kenya Airways employee who directed us to cross a busy airport road in the dark. There was no pedestrian crossing markings and she had no high vis gear on, we were lucky not to get run down by a bus that came around the corner suddenly. The onward flight to Heathrow passed without further incident however the breakfast served was appalling, a piece of unidentifiable gristle in the dish, truly the worst meal I have ever been served in over 50 years of flying. Kenya Airways standards on this showing have definitely slipped to well below par and they need to take note.",8th March 2016
250,"Flew from London Heathrow to Entebbe via Nairobi. Arrived early for check-in but then had to wait because one of the desks was being occupied by a family who were not travelling business but seemed to be negotiating over buying another ticket. I had booked both tickets and had selected adjoining seats but by the time we had checked in these have been changed. Even though I had paid for the tickets, I was told that I could not be told whether my travelling companion was still sitting next to me – data protection etc. in fact he had been put elsewhere. It was only at the gate that we managed to correct the problem. The aircraft was a newish Boeing 787 Dreamliner and although Kenya Airways had not opted for a more modern seat configuration, it was a relatively comfortable. A slightly larger pillow would have been appreciated. My IFE was not working (photo) although given that I wanted to sleep I was not particularly worried. The cabin crew apologised for not having a printed menu and instead let the passengers look at what appeared to be an email with the food options. The wine was uninspiring and the food lacklustre. However, the cabin crew were excellent: some of them had a slightly mischievous sense of humour, smiling and responded quickly to requests. Arriving at Nairobi was a disaster. First, the aircraft had to be towed in because of construction work and we were then put on a bus and taken to the arrivals terminal. There were no signs for transit passengers and when we asked, we were told that we had arrived at the wrong place. Needless to say nobody bothered to tell us. We then went on another bus and after an absurdly long wait finally got through security. The business lounge in Nairobi was small and we were forced to share a table. We decided to leave early and, eventually, the next flight, to Entebbe, was called. Absolutely no priority was given to business passengers. Although there was a separate line, passengers simply joined whichever was the shortest and the staff did nothing to ensure that those who had paid a premium were given priority treatment. We realise that running an airline involves juggling numerous different priorities and not every airline can aspire to the standards of Emirates or Qatar Airways, but with a little effort, and a negligible cost, Kenya Airways could have done considerably better than this.",5th March 2016
251,Kenya Airways from Johannesburg to Dar Es Salaam via Nairobi and back. B737-800 and Embraer 190 - all flights departed on time and all arrived earlier at destinations. Service from FA's could not be faulted - food was ok not wow but standard for airline economy meals. Going to Dar Es Salaam stopped in Nairobi for few days but on return was in transit in Nairobi for Johannesburg. Time allowed was 55 minutes from arriving from DAR departing to JNB and this was ample for the transfer whicH was smooth and painless.

We had to unwrap our luggage and repack it, give away some of our clothes and re-wrap the suitcases with seal film as luggage often gets broken into.

The 12.20 flight was delayed to 12.45 with relating inconvenience to passengers catching connecting flights and pick up arrangements, given that this was the Christmas long week end.

258,"London to Lilongwe via Nairobi. I've been flying with Kenya Airways for close to 10 years (after BA stopped flying directly to Malawi). I've enjoyed comfortable leg room and services at most times. But this trip was just terrible. After an 8hr+ flight, they had a 6 hour wait for connection for 12.35pm. Then when it was about 1.30h to go, it was cancelled without any sensible reason. Having been tired, I was angry by their lack of communication. They compensated with a hotel booking about 20-30min away. The hotel was comfortable and had excellent services. We were taken back to the airport for a 10pm flight naturally expecting to be in Lilongwe by just after midnight. To my horror this wasn't a direct flight, but was going through Zimbabwe first then back to Lilongwe (no sense in this whatsoever). To make it worse, it didn't leave until 11.15pm. During all this there was no apology or anything. I've noticed this is becoming very common with their flights to Malawi apparently where they cancel or delay without thought. I regret not buying insurance because I would have claimed. For a such a good airline doing well for Africa, it's really a pity. If South African Airways had favourable luggage allowance for their heavy price, I would have switched.  The new planes are too hot for comfort - I had a hoodie and a blanket expecting the typical cold inflight temperature, but no it was blazing in there.",25th November 2015

It was so hot that it felt like being suffocated and despite repeatedly asking for the temperature to be lowered nothing happened. I was only wearing a vest top and crop linen trousers so could not take anything else off. It was so unpleasant that I will not fly on a Kenya Airways Boeing 787 again. The cabin crew said that normal temperature is 24 degrees or people start getting cold. I say to them dress accordingly and give everyone else a chance, they can at least put more clothes on! The seating was also extremely cramped and the seat back entertainment system didn't work properly. Bad form for such a new aircraft.",6th November 2015

This is the second time this is happening. In April this year I was to travel to Botswana via Nairobi and the 0230 am flight was delayed up to 6am. Nobody told us what was happening. When I told the staff I was told I should not worry because the connecting flight to Joburg would wait for all passengers delayed - I was horrified on arrival in Nairobi to find I had to make my own arrangements and my onward flight to Gaborone could not be booked by staff in Nairobi - it was a nightmare.

262,"I don't even know where to start. I lost two days of my vacation due to flight delays from Douala to Dubai and Kenyan Airways gave the worst experience so far. When I was checking-in at the counter, I was quite pleased with a very helpful local ground staff. Before I left, I gave him 5000 CFA as a tip. The flight was delayed 6 hours so I checked in late as well. Suddenly, the staff was asking furiously for additional money because his superior saw him receiving a tip and he had to share the tip with others (couldn't believe) this really happened. He was bugging me in the most creepy way possible so I just decided to give another 5000 and left.  I was supposed to leave Douala at 1PM but we were only informed at around 4PM that they had to check us in overnight because there were some mechanical glitches with their plane. They checked us in at 2-star hotel in Douala for twin sharing-room! The room was like crate. We were finally picked up by van and we headed back to the airport. We boarded one hour late and because we were delayed for one day and I had a couple of connecting flights, my entire flight schedule got messed up. It seemed we were hostaged - not being histrionic but that was the feeling. They didn't issue a new plane ticket and asked us to claim the next ticket in Nairobi. So when we were supposed to catch the next flight from Nairobi to Dubai, we were a few minutes late and we weren't able to catch the flight. After 30 minutes of looking for somebody who can provide us information on how do we board the next flight, we were finally advised that we had to stay overnight in Nairobi and check-in at the hotel - again. There were three of us who were supposed to fly to Dubai. We insisted that they book us Etihad as it was the closest flight that time. They told us that they couldn't book another airline because it would be more expensive for them. They advised us instead that we could book and reimburse the expenses from them (yes, so if you like taking chances, one can consider). So we finally settled to stay overnight after they told us that we would be billeted on a 5-star hotel. We finally arrived at the ""5-star hotel"" only there was no air-conditioning. Yes, a hotel without an AC but a fan. We left Nairobi the following day and flew to Dubai. As soon as I get to Dubai, I requested my travel agent to cancel my return flight and reimburse me with my return flight. They offered instead that they would upgrade my cabin class to business for my return trip. The return trip had minimal delays and the business class experience was ok.

The regional product of KQ is excellent, personalized IFE great food for 3 hour flight and great pitch. Europan airlines don't even come close on medium haul flights. They deserve that 4th star.",21st July 2015
265,"Staff are poorly trained and make no effort to assist customers. We were advised of a flight delay of 2 hours when checking in from Zanzibar to Nairobi to our 10 am flight. No formal explanation was given which coincidentally became 3 hours, which then effected all our connecting flights and accommodation. We were not assisted in even the slightest way. Having then to wait for a further 15 hours between flights till we could get to our final destination. We were all advised incorrectly.  This turned a precious family holiday into one with a nightmare ending! Thank you Kenya Airways for spoiling our precious time away. I am disgusted by your service and lack of empathy or service values. ",11th July 2015
266,"On time departures and early arrivals which was good. Early morning flights to NBO and DAR. The Lounge in MBA was well stocked with snacks and beverages, was quite comfortable. Was served breakfast in a 40min flight which was very impressive and it was fresh and delicious. Short Layover so couldn't use the Lounge in NBO. Flight crew were very helpful. Return had the same experience.",6th July 2015
267,MBA-NBO-BOM-NBO-MYD. Early morning flight from MBA and a small quick connection in NBO towards BOM. Both flights were on time. The aircraft was a brand new Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner to BOM. Extremely comfortable aircraft. Inflight entertainment was updated and good choice of movies ambience of the aircraft was pleasant and seats were very comfortable. The crew both on ground and inflight were cheerful helpful and smiling. Food was delicious. Return was the same experience just the very long wait in NBO connecting to MYD. Otherwise had an excellent experience and would fly Kenya Airways Again.,20th May 2015
268,Traveled from Bombay to Johannesburg BOM-NBO-JNB and JNB-NBO-BOM. On time departures good food. No inflight entertainment in Boeing 737 but available on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner on NBO-BOM sector. Overall satisfied.,11th May 2015
269,KQ782 LLW-NBO via LUS. Embraer E80 Seat 1F. Excellent service good catering and clean comfortable aircraft. Kept well updated by flight crew following a 1.5-hour delay out of LLW after late arrival of the aircraft. KQ did a good job of getting the flight turned around and back off the ground. My first experience with KQ and was impressed overall.,11th May 2015
270,From Bangkok KQ0861 to LLW KQ0726 via NBO on 17 April. (A Skyteam platinum for life member). The flight from BKK to NBO was OK left on time and arrived on time. The service was fine in a new B787. One hour prior to the departure to LLW the flight was cancelled and we were put in a hotel in town until the next day. No explanations of the cancellation just operational reasons. We ask for a manager to handle the situation but a supervisor told us that no one was available or reachable. We ask to reschedule our flights with other airline but they could done since they need to be authorized by a manager. We were rescheduled on the next flight 12 hours latter via Lusaka reaching LLW at 2.30 am the following day after three days since I left BKK. Of course no compensation at all after wasting 2 working days in the airport of Nairobi. They have invested heavily in planes but the service to clients is really poor. The quality of service is really gone down and they are forgetting that other alternatives are possible nowadays.,19th April 2015
271,I had paid a lot of money to fly my young sons as unaccompanied minors. Their ticket said it would take 1 hour to fly from Mt Kilimanjaro to Nairobi. No-one said anything on check in however they ended up going via Zanzibar and arrived into Nairobi 3 hours late. The missed their connecting flights and were stranded in the airport. No one met them at the plane and no one helped them. They were told to sleep at the airport overnight. After they bought a phone card and rang me I then got onto the airline and they eventually helped them to stay overnight at a hotel in town and put onto flights the next day. If I had not pushed them they would be sleeping at the airport for 20 hours. Two young children. Totally irresponsible. I will never use the airline again.,16th April 2015
272,MYD-NBO-EBB. Flights were on time on both lags. The Business Class Lounge at the New Terminal 1A was excellent. Nice hot meals of different varieties comfortable seats and sleeping area WC were clean and sparkling. In-Flight and Ground Crew were both very helpful and smiling. The Flight time were short but enjoyed the service.,28th March 2015
273,KQ861 & 860 HKG-BKK-HKG. First flight with Kenya Airways turned out to be the worst air travel experience. The outbound flight was cancelled without prior notice. Passengers kept queuing in front of Kenya Airways counter at HKG airport with no information. Staff at the counter asked passengers to wait in the queue for hours until finally the airline managed to offer an alternative flight with another airline but will depart 5 hours later. Very poor management of the situation. Passengers were confused and exhausted.,4th March 2015
274,My wife and I used the airline for 8 flights to (and in) East Africa from Heathrow recently. The aircraft's were new clean and comfortable. Staff were excellent on every flight and could not have done more for us. Hitherto we have used British Airways because they happen to fly direct to Entebbe but now we will always use their Nairobi connection even though there is a stop off. Kenya Airways attitude and their lovely staff make the B.A. crates and ageing crews on the African routes no longer acceptable.,4th March 2015
275,I am a seasoned business traveller for 40 years. Flew Kenya Airways Bangkok to Dar es Salaam via Nairobi in Feb 2015. Initially was nervous because the business ticket price was so low less than half the nearest competitor. However on the downside flight left 30 mins late (no big deal). On the upside access to Air France Lounge New Dreamliner with flat beds good pillows and big warm blankets great entertainment service was very good and the food was fine. Transit through Nairobi using Simba lounge - good facilities cooked breakfast etc. then onto Dar in an older 737 but still comfortable and well cared for. I have travelled with the best and this was as good as any business class trip I have had with any major airline.,12th February 2015
276,Flew Business Class round trip CDG (Paris) to/from NBO (Nairobi) on the wonderful new Kenya Airways 787 Dreamliner. (CDG-NBO #113 on Jan-1-15 and NBO-CDG #112 on Jan 9-15) What an airliner and what wonderful service by the caring flight staff. The plane really is the best airliner in the sky right now quiet w/ photochromatic adjustable oversized windows excellent air circulation and higher humidity. As for Kenya Airways they made these two flights extremely comfortable with great food excellent South African wines great lay flat seats (2+2+2 configuration) very adequate inflight AV and very caring services presentation. In addition the Pride and Simba lounges at the new Jomo Kenyatta International Airport Terminal are world class now as well with excellent food beverage TVs quiet areas beautiful bathrooms w/ showers quality WIFI connection - everything you would expect from a Skyteam partner.,26th January 2015
277,On this very short flight from Nairobi to Kilimanjaro I flew on a brand spanking new E-190. Was very impressed with the plane - plenty legroom love the big windows and each seat also had its own built-in IFE screen. Never seen that on a regional jet. Staff are very friendly and if you sit on the left hand side of the plane you can see Kilimanjaro towering at 5895 m as you're landing in Arusha.,19th January 2015
278,I was flying from NBI-BOM and BOM-NBI in 777-300 and return was 777-200 check in went well during both flights. Inflight service was good the flight attendants were polite and helpful. The seats are pretty comfortable. I would recommend this airline.,19th January 2015
279,KQ 202 on 3/1/2015. KQ203 on 9/1/2015. NBO-BOM-NBO. First of all I will compliment the New KQ Terminal which is excellent. The flight was on a new Boeing 777-300ER. Departed on time. The flight was full. Meal was good and I asked for a second round. Despite the flight being full the air hostess without any hesitation and with a smile on her face served me for the 2nd time. The seats were comfy and IFE was OK. Needs an update and increase the movie and music options. Return flight was also good. Ground Service crew were all kind and helpful. Departed on time and landed on time to. Would recommend KQ to everyone who would like to travel to KQ route network. Keep up the good work KQ.,19th January 2015
280,Flew from Paris via Amsterdam to Nairobi. The 777-300 from AMS/NBO was a new aircraft. The seat width and pitch was OK. The seat back entertainment was fairly limited. The food and beverage service was extremely slow. Bearing in mind that the flight departed at 20.40 the service did not begin for at least 2 hours after take off. Cabin crew was pleasant and helpful. My return flight was on the Dreamliner. The seat pitch and width were OK however the seat itself is very hard I had to use the small pillow they provide to sit on. I can't say that I noticed a huge difference between the Dreamliner and the 777 other that the size of the aircraft. If I was doing that route again I would consider flying with KQ.,14th January 2015
281,It was with some trepidation that I used Kenya Airways for a last minute flight up to the UK from Zambia. However I have to say that I was really surprised by how much they have improved in the 6 years since I last used them. The Embraer jet from Lusaka to Nairobi was clean. The meal small but tasty and there was some IFE on the seat back TVs. The plane seemed quite new and the staff efficient and smiling. Punctuality was also excellent. An even bigger surprise was the new modern airport at Nairobi. We were transferred quickly onto the London flight and although it was an older 777 it was not full so there were many spare seats at the back. Again we were on time getting to London. Well done KQ on all that you have achieved!,5th January 2015
282,"Yesterday we were on a direct flight from Lagos to Nairobi except that without previous notice the plane landed in Cotonou Benin for over one hour. Not only that but the airplane didn't have air conditioning during the first two ours of flight. I had purchased and paid for a direct flight in business class and I was given a flight with one layover in a class for animal or merchandise transport. I can't believe that they call themselves ""The pride of Africa"".",29th December 2014
283,MBA-NBO-BOM-NBO-MBA. All flights were on time and arrived earlier than the ATA. Flight Attendants and Ground service were very friendly. On-board meal was ok and flight was comfortable too. Would for sure fly KQ again and hopefully fly KQ all the time I choose to travel.,22nd December 2014
284,Flew NBO-AMS B777-300 business class and NBO-JNB-NBO Dreamliner / B737-800 business class during last month. The JNB sectors with a 1-year old baby and all flights a true pleasure. Brand new aircraft on all sectors; particularly impressed with the B787 and B737-800. Excellent service by the cabin crew particularly on the sectors traveling with baby - very helpful. New Pride lounge at NBO is world-class in terms of design and finishes. Food on-board and in the NBO lounge remains somewhat mediocre the rest is tip-top.,22nd December 2014
285,I flew from Nairobi to Amsterdam towards the end of November. The new 777's have a good business class cabin and the seats offer a nice level of comfort. The quality of food and drink was good and is getting closer to that offered by the bigger international airlines on this route. I have always found Kenya Airways Cabin Crews pleasant and helpful but I did not see much of them between meal services. It would be nice if they made a tour of the cabin at reasonable intervals just to see if anyone needs anything rather than waiting to be called.,18th December 2014
286,Recently flew from LHR to Nairobi on to Kilimanjaro and then return with Kenya Airways. Both of the long haul flights were overnight and the major bonus of flying with this carrier is that the plane was 2/3 empty on the outbound leg (so we got 3 seats each and a great night's sleep) and half-full on the return so we had 3 seats between 2 of us. However on the outbound journey none of the seat-back TVs worked in the centre and right hand seats most were just dead others flickered fitfully and most annoying my screen just wouldn't turn off. Also the reading lights didn't work so it was a good job we could sleep! However all four flights departed and arrived on time and the cabin crew didn't wake us up for breakfast.,4th December 2014
287,I recently flew MAN to MBA via AMS and NBO. Overall a very pleasant flight. All flights took off and landed on time. I'll only mention the AMS to NBO to MBA sections because they were all Kenya flights. The 777-300 ER from AMS to NBO had the 3-3-3 arrangement which meant a little more room than I usually get on other airlines. The food was decent enough the wine ok and plenty off it. The service although not perfect was fine. The IFE is not upto Emirates quality but since I don't sit for the entire flight the movie choice was ok. The flight from NBO to MBA was on a well equipped Embraer 190 which even had its own IFE quite a novelty on a short hop flight and something I've never seen in Europe. The only fly in the ointment was NBO but that is not the airlines fault that's KAA's issue. Its a bit of a nightmare for an international arrival with a domestic transfer. But overall a decent flight I would certainly fly them again.,6th November 2014
288,Recently took four Kenya Airways flights between London and Tanzania and every flight arrived at the destination early staff were friendly and helpful food was good and the flight price was excellent for this time of the year. I fly this route 2 or 3 times a year always with Kenya Airways and I'm yet to be disappointed.,22nd October 2014
289,Flew from NBO to Jo'burg with friends on golfing holiday (Group of 12). We fly KQ a lot in Kenya and we all knew it's a horrible airline before we booked but we did not have much choice and were ok because KQ normally fly golf bags for free. Nope - they've changed their minds on this route and tried to sting us each for $120 excess baggage. One couple paid and the rest of us refused - they finally let us on because we were holding up the check-in for everyone else. No in-flight entertainment of course but flight was actually on time which is a nice change for KQ. My wife and I booked our seats in advance but found they had been given up to others (part of my group so we did not make a fuss) and my wife and were given seats two rows apart. Luckily other people were prepared to swap so we could sit together. Hopelessly unprofessional airline from time of booking to time of landing but what can you do? I'd never fly KQ if I had a choice. Flight back was exactly the same except they let us bring our clubs for free because we had a letter from the tour operator saying we were entitled.,14th September 2014
290,NBO-DEL. We were served only 1 samosa each for dinner. MUM-NBO flight was cancelled but before I left NBO the office confirmed that I was reserved on the next flight. On enquiring a day before travel was informed that I wasn't booked! He booked me then lucky enough there was space! NBO-MUM they said there's an hours delay it was actually 8 hours delayed! Missed the connecting flight to Kolkata paid an extra 3500 rupees for the next flight only the return from DEL-NBO was on time and well managed. KQ never again!,10th September 2014
291,I flew Business Class from Bangkok to Nairobi and it was one of my worst flight experiences. The Business Class cabin was virtually empty 3 other passengers. The food was the same as Economy a chicken/patty/hamburger with overcooked vegetables and none of the wines on the impressive wine list were available - only the NZ Chardonnay they were serving in Economy. The IFE did not work which I reported to the Purser - was on the same plane same seat on return journey - still not working. On arrival at Nairobi I was woken on final approach - no time for even a cup of coffee. The stewardess said she had not wanted to wake me - but had not asked the night before if I would be wanting breakfast. A much shorter flight and also more expensive than Qatar which I usually choose on this route. Never again.,28th August 2014
292,Our flight from Guangzhou to Bangkok was cancelled. This is actually not something unusual. However the handling of this situation by the local staff was an absolute disaster. Initially the flight was delayed for three hours until they eventually made the decision to cancel it. We were put up in a below average hotel and left in the dark about further arrangements. The next day we called them every half hour but they themselves did not know what went on. Furthermore they told us that we could not easily get our luggage. In the end I had to get very angry. Only then did they become more co-operative. However the pilot did not allow the luggage to be released from the airport until the afternoon of the next day. Due to this we almost missed the next flight. Never again!,26th August 2014
293,"Flew return London to Nairobi with ""The Pride of Africa"". The website is amateur looking and booking a seat is confusing. I did book with a travel agent and they said we would have to pay for extra legroom seats. However when I logged on I discovered row 33 DFG were all free to book with extra leg room. The service was basic food was bad my entertainment system was old and did not work  when I asked a member of staff to look they just walked off. So 8 hours with no entertainment system the fact I had legroom helped me to relax. A man sitting next to me said their entertainment systems quite often do not work. Staff looked like they did not want to be there. On Returning from Zanzibar we were told we would have to pay $100 each for extra leg room. As the card machine was not working on the Kenya Airways desk my friend was taken for a 45 minute walk to get this booked. Terrible experience and I would never fly with them again.",18th August 2014
294,We have been using KQ for the past 14 years out of Malawi and it is a love/hate relationship. I trust the pilots and the airline technicians. If KQ management would go the extra step they would graduate into another category. However very often its the individual flight attendants that keep me booking and flying KQ. We flew Economy and Business - both with different experiences. I was about not to book KQ anymore until the new dreamliner came in. Nice aircraft - friendly crew. The inflight service needs improvement. I have had better service in Economy than in Business class at times. The inflight entertainment program and equipment did not work on previous flights (both classes) except the new planes. Would I fly KQ again? Yes but if I can fly KLM equipment I would chose KLM because it is predictable in terms of standard and quality. The new Dreamliners will only be attractive as long as KQ maintains these aircraft well and keeps them clean and the inflight entertainment works.,14th August 2014
295,NBO-DXB. They have started flying the B772 on this route. Pleasant and comfortable flight very welcome break from the ageing B767 a/c. Attentive crew and cabin service seems to have been revamped plenty of drinks rounds etc. The only qualm is the catering to basic and could do with some improvement. Overall a good flight.,6th August 2014
296,I travelled to Uganda via Nairobi (Kenya) last month. The plane rides differ massively in quality. The flight to Kenya left on time but I feel it was let down by many things: 1) The plane being very old. 2) A lot of the TV's don't work mine did but the film like many other people said stopped working near the end. 3) The food quality was really bad. I however then had a flight from Nairobi to Uganda and this was really good the plane was very new and had working TV's with pretty new films (it was only 1 hour flight). Another thing was we got served food and drinks. This was far better than the flight from London.,29th July 2014
297,Amsterdam - Narobi on new B777-300ER. An excellent flight - comfortable seats with very good legroom. The base of the seat goes forward when the back reclines which makes it far more comfortable for sleeping. Kenya Airways have kept a 3-3-3 arrangement so the seats are wider. Food tasty and cabin crew friendly and professional. Nice welcome from captain. Good inflight entertainment. Connecting flight to Dar-es-Salaam equally straightforward and comfortable. Very keen to use Kenya Airways again - far superior to KLM who they codeshare the AMS-NBO route with.,10th July 2014
298,I flew from Nairobi to Paris on the new Boeing 787 that now operates this route. The aircraft is new and has great inflight entertainment seats are comfortable and legroom is good. I'm a tall guy and I really struggle with legroom on most aircraft's. The crew were very friendly. Overall great experience.,10th July 2014
299,"I have flown London - Lilongwe - London the past few weeks. I arrived safely. It is disappointing that the in- flight entertainment system does not work London - Nairobi - London. It amused me that the crew still hand- out the headphones. Apparently headphones keep passengers amused - until they realise nothing works. The food was good (goat stew) - avoid the breakfast ""eggs"". The cabin crew excellent. The airline survives on it's route network - and cheap flights. With 'code-share' flights check what airline is actually providing the flight. I am using Kenya Airways again this month. Would I use them if there was a realistic alternative on the routes? Not sure. But I still rated Kenya Airways 4 out of 5 for 'Value for Money'.",6th July 2014

301,KQ116 2014/6/26 from Nairobi to Amsterdam. We had a very good flight with friendly stewards a very good entertainment and good food and drinks. We will ever fly again with this company.,30th June 2014
302,15th June KQ 202. I travelled to Mumbai. The Boeing 777-200ER was good comfortable seats service was great and friendly. I am sure this airlines will become one of the best with the new Dreamliners and 777-300ER.,25th June 2014
303,Kenya Airways used to be one of my favourite carriers - ok they were not in the same league as Emirates but they did a good job considering the price. Over the last few years things have been going steadily downhill and over the last few trip I have done with them they have reached new depths. The in-flight entertainment system simply does not work on the London-Nairobi flight and the aircrew are clearly aware that the system has simply died. They promised a new system and new planes are coming soon - I just hope it is soon enough to save the airline.,16th June 2014
304,I flew LHR-NBO return and was generally satisfied by the service. It's nothing special but the 777 are relatively comfortable (showing some sign of age) - the best feature in both directions was that there were plenty of spare seats so passengers were able to spread out and I found the overnight timings most convenient. I found the food and drink poor however (particularly hard to face food overstrained tea and vile juice) and the in-flight entertainment distinctly average (limited range of films poor sound quality broken in several seats). Basically it's an acceptable in-flight experience that gets you efficiently from A to B and the ground experience is much more professional/competent than many other African airlines from my experience. Staff were generally friendly (with exception of some check-in staff at NBO who were grumpy).,10th June 2014
305,"Travelled on KQ from Nairobi to Bangkok in economy. A horrible experience. ""Pride of Africa"" what a joke! The food was terrible the seating in the 767 was so tight that I have has better space in much smaller aircraft's. The on board service was despicable. The staff acted as though they were doing you a favour by serving food and drink. I would never travel Kenya Airways again.",2nd June 2014
306,The inflight entertainment only worked for some people mine didn't work at all. The flight was full so we had no option of moving. The flight was more than 6 hours so it was very boring. The were only 2 options for food: Chicken or vegetarian. Naturally most people chose chicken so by the time the staff got to us there was only vegetarian food left. We didn't get much to drink either. I've either been spoiled by Emirates' excellent service or this airline is just very poor because I was absolutely disgusted by the service.,29th May 2014
307,MBA-NBO-CAN-NBO-MBA.. 1st leg was an Embraer E190 and the 2nd was a new Boeing 777-300ER. The flight was good. Had 3 seats all the way to CAN to myself and slept very comfortably. Business Class service in Economy. Flight attendants were responsive to calls and gave good service. Return had a problem of checked in luggage which was removed due to power banks inside. Was informed about it by a KQ staff but then due to language barrier and a lazy security guard who didn't want to walk all the way to the check in counter told me all was OK and to board. Reaching NBO I didn't get my bag for 2 days. All in all the flight was good and on time both ways.,26th May 2014
308,I have flown a number of times on the Bangkok-Nairobi route and had a mixed set of experiences. Seats are good for sleeping and food is edible mostly. I approach it as super premium economy with some business perks and I am not disappointed. I rarely watch in-flight entertainment but it doesn't work sometimes - that is a fact. Don't expect too much in terms of communication if there is trouble but they have generally been okay with us. Only one serious delay in 8 years (door wouldn't close) and we were treated okay in Business (slow but sure) but the economy passengers were left at the gate all night with minimal information late refreshments and little help. Basically they were dumped because Kenya Airways only had enough staff left on duty to take care of us and they had to wait until we were shuttled off to our hotel before they got any attention.,25th May 2014
309,Just last week I was on another Kenya Airways flight but this time the experience far from what I'd expected. The aircraft itself had only just returned to Nairobi with a full load of passengers about an hour before we boarded it. Of course it had been prepared for our flight but not well enough - the toilet I used even before departure was grubby the carpeting on the floor of the passenger cabin still had tiny remnants of a food spill from the previous flight the inflight entertainment system worked only partly - the flight tracker did not work at all throughout the 8 hr flight to Amsterdam - the choice in movies and music was so limited and the sound quality so inadequate. A far cry from the very enjoyable flight on the KLM B747-400 that had flown me on the outward leg. But the food was fairly good and there was one or two particularly attractive flight attendants.,7th May 2014
310,8 flights in 6 weeks with 'The Pride of Africa'. 4 flights without the inflight entertainment working. Whole rows of seats had similar problems. All 777. Staff not able nor did they appear to care about the problems. Letter to KQ had a few platitudes back. Don't fly KQ long haul.,30th April 2014
311,My wife and I arrived in Guangzhou on 26 Dec 2013 from Melbourne to connect with Kenya airways to Nairobi. In summery we faced lots of inconveniences simply due to language problems. The flight to Nairobi was cancelled but none of the staff could tell us what was going on. The airline should consider having Swahili or English speaking staff permanently stationed in Guangzhou.,13th April 2014
312,Flew NBO-AMS on B777: Flight was on time and aircraft quite new. The staff were nice. There could have been more thorough pre-takeoff and pre-landing aisle checks for seat belts etc. The entertainment system was ok good choice of movies but the sound was low. The food was ok We departed on time: The business class seats were comfortable and the cabin was clean. A rather good experience.,6th April 2014
313,First time traveller with KA and returning with them also but given the choice to the same destination next time I will make sure the flight is with KLM. The reason for my disappointment was the food provided. The breakfast served was pathetic fruit juice yoghurt bread roll margarine and jam and a bagel are not for me. Then on the connecting flight to Mombasa I received an apple turnover and some coffee. Sorry KA but that just isn't breakfast to me. Cabin Crew were friendly and efficient flight was good but to lose customers for poor food is pretty bad.,1st April 2014
314,Flew AMS-NBO on B777 and NBO-CDG on the B767-300. The B777 was fine but nothing special. Friendly staff. Slightly little legroom but fine. IFE ok not much choice and slightly bad sound but still fine. The temporary arrivals terminal in NBO is small but efficient. The B767 was worse. Legroom was extraordinary small. The only thing that made it bearable to sit for almost 9 hours at the seat was that I had two seats for myself. Quite old plane too entertainment system was not on demand. Good staff however and the food was ok. The B777 is recommended try to avoid the old B767.,10th March 2014
315,16th Feb 2014 LHR-Nairobi. Flight on time. Very clean aircraft. Not full so able to spread out. Comfy chairs good IFE and movie choice. Food was delicious requested Vegan meal and it was delivered. Cabin crew were lovely and attentive. Drinks were given by the double! Honestly couldn't fault them brilliant flight.,10th March 2014
316,Flew from NBO to Heathrow on the 777. Flight delayed 45 mins because otherwise we would have arrived at Heathrow before 6am on a Sunday. Surely the Operations people could have scheduled the flight accordingly? Seats were rock hard and uncomfortable. Service by the all male cabin crew was erratic. IFE was OK. Not recommended but there is a distinct lack of competition on this route so there is not a lot of choice.,4th March 2014
317,KQ860 NBO-BKK. 767-300. Flight was 99% full and ground staff and FA's were efficient with the boarding process and managed to get everyone seated in time (despite the large amount of duty free items brought on board). There were a lot of Chinese/Thai flight attendants to deal with the Chinese/Thai speaking passengers. Hand luggage size rules were (generally) obeyed by passengers. Flight arrived about an hour early. FA's were friendly and had good English. Good selection of beverages (and generous amounts). Food was also good. Leg room and seat width was adequate. Good magazine. A few noticeable issues: The turning off of electronic devices prior to takeoff and landing was not enforced by staff and staff were also not strict enough with regards to passengers standing up going to the toilets etc. during taxiing. There could have been more thorough pre-takeoff and pre-landing aisle checks for seat belts etc. by the FA's. Sometimes there were no announcements by FA's when the seatbelt sign was turned on by the captain during turbulence and passengers of whom disobeyed the sign were not told to hurry up and sit down - people continued to move around the cabin. There were seat back TV's (channels) but the content was not working (blank black screens on all channels except for the flight data). FA's were notified but could not be fixed. The safety video needs updating and the audio from the loudspeakers was too soft. There were no night aisle walks by FA's with water/juice - they seemed to disappear after the meal service. Overall good for an African airline and has improved over the past years but needs a few more finishing touches before it is on par with a lot of other major international carriers. Good value for money.,30th January 2014
318,Flew from HRE-LHR via NBO in economy the HRE-NBO-HRE sector was on the E190 cabin was clean cabin crew were friendly and attentive. NBO-LHR was on the B777-2 seats were not that comfortable could not sleep. LHR-NBO flight got delayed by over an hour. Disappointed arriving at HRE to find out one bag was lost only to arrive 2 days later.,13th January 2014
319,I travelled on 24th December from NBO-DAR. We travelled on quite a new Embraer 190. Very clean though boarding was late we still left on time and arrived on time IFE was working though it was very boring. The crew were constantly hardworking and kind of strict. The return flight DAR-NBO was quite the same a rather older Embraer 190 boarding late again but we took off and arrived on time at least the cabin crew were much kinder upon arrival we found our baggage at the new arrivals terminal which I have to say is the most beautiful African terminal I've seen. With all that I have to say I had the best regional flights ever. Thumbs up to Kenya Airways short haul flights.,13th January 2014
320,MYD-NBO. It was an Embraer E170. Took off on time and landed 20 min early. Was travelling with my infant and so they gave me a very good service at both airports - Malindi Airport and Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. Gave me a front seat so I sat very comfortably throughout the flight. In-flight was also impressive was served snacks with very cheery FA's. Got a very nice view of the Mount Kilimanjaro peak which was informed to us by the Captain. Overall I would prefer KQ as my first choice.,13th January 2014
321,Flew from NBO-AMS then connection on KLM to the US. I fly using this itinerary every six months and have done for the last four years. Rather mediocre service. This flight was delayed for two hours due to the fact that the passenger loader was not working. No announcements were made in the lounge. The Simba Lounge was closed to me even though I showed the Delta Club Membership. Check in at the counter was sub-par as was lining up for Immigration. Asked for water for medication I was taking three times. If you are sleeping they do not serve you nor leave the headset etc in the magazine pouch in front of you. On arrival in Amsterdam you are met with armed security personnel checking your passport.,6th January 2014
322,Flight from NBO to MSA. Good experience and seem like high standards. Used the SIMBA lounge as well. There was a huge storm in NBO and the staff checked and rechecked the boarding passes. An elderly lady was in a wheelchair and couldn't don the plastic raincoats they gave us for the trip to the plane (no passenger loader). No one helped her with the raincoat. I helped her and then asked the KQ Staff to help out. They just stood around I guess expecting to be told what to do? Another check by the loading stairs then another check at the entrance of the aircraft with lines forming and people getting wet. Otherwise the flight was ok.,6th January 2014
323,NBO-MBA. It was a new Embraer E190. Flight was on time. Flight was full. FA were in a sparkling mood ever smiling and welcoming. Was served with nuts and soft drinks. Good information from the First officer. IFE was working but flight time was short. Overall had a nice flight.,27th November 2013
324,We flew overnight LHR to Nairobi then back overnight 8 days later after our Kuoni safari. Both were 777-200 quite old but seemed well maintained. Seats 3-3-3 firm but leg room OK. Seat allocation very good: on outward trip it was under 80% full and they gave us 3 seats for the 2 of us. Staff very cheery and efficient drinks plentiful food good except breakfast on return (boring no fruit). Toilets kept clean & dry. Took tablets so can't comment on IFA. No problems at Nairobi airport despite the fire.,27th November 2013
325,Bangkok to Nairobi. Old Plane with passengers already on board transiting from China food and rubbish everywhere. Ripped seats that do not recline. No music or TV/Movies at all not even a large screen nearby. Very long flight with young children with no entertainment would not fly with them again. We had ordered a child meal but were told they had run out.,10th November 2013
326,NBO-JUB (Juba South Sudan)-NBO. Excellent flights in a new Embraer 190 both ways. Aircraft clean and appealing. Onward flight on time full service 3 option hot meals offered. Drinks plenty inc alcoholic beverages. FA service excellent despite flight completely full in both classes. Granted lounge access in NBO and 60 kg luggage due to Skyteam gold status. Flight back to NBO also about full. Departed 30 Minutes prior to scheduled (arrived similarly early). Food was less good only 2 options (goat and chisken) and of much smaller size and meat was grinded. 2 wines are offered (absolutely undrinkable). Inflight entertainment not working despite individual monitors mounted. Power outlets at every seat. Tickets expensive as KQ enjoys very little competition on the route.,10th November 2013
327,Terrible experience with Kenya Airways. Flew from London to Nairobi in September. After losing our luggage they didn't seem very concerned or willing to help. We had to keep complaining to get them to do anything and kept getting passed from one employee to another. The next morning we had to fly from Nairobi to Kilimanjaro on Precision Air which is a subsidiary of Kenya Airways and got bumped from our flight until 12 hours later. Then they didn't take anyone's luggage on the flight! They told us that the luggage would arrive the next day but it didn't arrive until 4 days later. By that time we were on Mount Kilimanjaro using rented and purchased gear. At no time did the airline offer to reimburse us. Finally at the end of our trip we had to fly on Kenya airways from Nairobi to London. We arrived at the airport 3 hours before the flight and when we checked in the agent told us we were on standby! We created a big enough stink that they gave us our boarding passes. Then the flight was 3 hours late departing. Also on both Air Kenya flights the food wasn't very good and the inflight entertainment units didn't work well. If we ever fly back to Africa we would never fly Kenya Airways again.,4th November 2013
328,MBA-NBO-CAN-NBO-MBA. It was a quite old Boeing 767-300ER but well maintained. Flight was on time. Very hard- working in a sparkling mood and attentive airline crew members. Good information from captain and purser. I was impressed. Keep it up Kenya Airways.,22nd October 2013
329,NBO-KIS-NBO domestic 11-14 September respectively. Both flights on time. Aircraft's (Airbus 320 and Embraer 190 respectively) were clean and well-functioning. The temporary airport in NBO now have established a cozy tented temporary lounge for elite flyers good initiative as compared to 2 weeks ago. Drink and snack (2 bags of nuts) service on board but no hot drinks offered (50 minutes flights). No entertainment. No gate corridors must walk on the tarmac to and from plane. FA staff nice and caring despite busy. VIP-lounge in Kisumu accessed (by Flying Blue gold card) but must pay for all the items served.,16th September 2013
330,NBO-EDL-NBO. Domestic flights all on time. Due to the newly burnt NBO airport boarding was primitive and lengthy and we were 5-10 passengers who lost our flight due to lack of calls for boarding other routes were announced clearly. As there was a mess in the temporarily domestic airport there were no facilities no signboard nor search for passengers. Strangely enough my luggage was unloaded (correctly) but I was furious as I was accused for No Show despite sitting straight in front of the only exit way in the tent where all domestic passengers had to walk through to their flights. However some apology was received and they rebooked me instantly for the following morning but only as a “prioritized waitlist passenger. However I got the last seat and was pleased to eventually get it. Otherwise all flights on time pleasant FA-service and good announcements on board. Almost new aircraft's Embraer 175 and 170 respectively. No lounges available despite holding SkyTeam Gold. After request they offered me 1 snack and 1 soft drink in Nairobi. The lounge in EDL not available for non-VIPs.,26th August 2013
331,LHR-NBO-LHR. LHR-NBO departed on time aircraft was a very tired 777-200 ER NVOD didn't work food was very poor the only upside was the flight attendants who were always helpful! Seats were extremely uncomfortable and I could feel springs. Most airline food is never very good but this was awful it was very over cooked and was all stuck together. NBO-LHR departed over an hour late as aircraft was parked at the wrong part of the airport so we were made to sit in a tent on the apron in darkness until someone got fuel for a generator once on the aircraft it was again a rather tired 777-200 ER and was again in a seat which probably hasn't seen a cushion in 10 years! NVOD still didn't work which made for a long flight. Food was marginally better. Again I cannot fault cabin crew who were very attentive. Overall though it was not enough to make me want to book with KQ again.,21st August 2013
332,USA-AMS-NRB. Flight fine until we got to NRB late evening and had to deal with Kenyan customs who extort money. I had no extra or overweight luggage but was told I had to pay duty for my toddler nieces and nephews clothes while I watched multitude of passengers go by with extra tots. NRB-AMS-USA flight had the worst meals: breakfast croissant and bread. FA's appeared tired and bothered when requested for anything especially water. The food products were dirty: yoghurt with old dried yoghurt on the side tray appeared messy/haphazardly setup. Food was better when it was under NAS. Service has really declined what a shame!,11th August 2013
333,Overnight flight to Nairobi from Schipol. Seating was very uncomfortable where sleep was near impossible. Service onboard was attentive. On the return flight to Schipol I found the food tray to be dirty. Service was reasonable but not as good as the outbound flight. I have flown with Kenya Airways for some 9 years for some reason the overall service has slipped. I've just compared Kenya Airways with BA where the cost is some £400 higher the journey time is much reduced and I would be reasonably confident that BA can match or beat Kenya Airways on service.,4th August 2013
334,DXB-NBO operated by Kenya Airways codeshare with SU. Boeing 767-200 in a 2-3-2 seat configuration. Aircraft a bit old but well maintained. Flight full. Overbooked on business class 1 person was downgraded. I got one of the very last seats in the middle of an 2-3-2 configuration. But the staff were good hard-working in a sparkling mood and attentive. Ordered 2 drinks and was given 2 of each (as to make up for busy FAs and few rounds of service). This happened to everybody who cared but only at the first service- IFE on large plenum screen worked surprisingly well. Good information from captain and purser. Aircraft parked far from gate. Luggage delivery at the belts in Nairobi messy with tonnes of unpicked suitcases all over the place. Monitors were not properly working thus need to check 6 belts to get luggage as staff were giving incoherent information.,31st July 2013
335,Nairobi - Lusaka in July 2013. Was worried as have experienced KQ's long haul service before and Nairobi airport is horrendous. However this was a great flight. New Embraer 190 individual IFE (that worked!) good in-flight service. Departure/arrival on time. Given they have no real competition on this route I was impressed.,30th July 2013
336,CDG-NBO-EBB and EBB-NBO-AMS. First flight was an hour late in departing IFE had a horrible crackle only 5 movies on the 767-300 one of which they only showed half of. Food was ok school dinner like really only got a lunch meal (pasta followed by chicken curry and apple pie) dinner was a tuna roll which is not a dinner considering the flight was landing at 9pm and 9 hrs long. Seats were uncomfortable material very lose and faded. NBO-EBB was a brand new Embraer 190 excellent comfort leather seats steak and cheese roll much better same on the return leg but got a continental breakfast. NBO-AMS was a 777-200er similarly poor condition but had new IFE 20+ movies but some didn't work. My IFE worked on the my side of the plane (seat fghj) the other side (a-e) were all broken meals again were poor. Won't be flying again KLM BA or Emirates next time.,30th July 2013
337,Outbound: YYZ-JNB via AMS and NBO. Inbound: JNB-YYZ via NBO and AMS. Flew KLM on YYZ-AMS on an old soon to be retired mighty MD-11 but the cabin looked new. Flight on time. No PTVs in Business Class but I slept almost the entire flight. Service was great. Had an 8 hour layover in Amsterdam. Nightmare began when boarding the AMS-NBO flight. Plane was a moderate Boeing 777-200ER. Garbage all over the floor no PTVs seats that can't recline for standard Business Class and some broken tray tables. Left an hour late. The food for Business Class looked like plastic and it somewhat tasted like plastic. Arrived 15 minutes late the next morning. Nairobi's airport was in very poor shape. NBO-JNB - Luckily it was the gate next to where I arrived. Flight was operated by an old Boeing 737-700. Seats better than AMS-NBO flight cabin clean but some tray tables were missing. Flight delayed because of morning traffic congestion. Flight attendants very polite. Arrived later than scheduled. On the return the JNB-NBO flight wasn't delayed but the Boeing 737-700 was awful. The next day we board at around 8am but the plane wasn't even at the gate. A replacement airplane a very poor looking Boeing 767-300ER was towed to the gate at 9.00. Boarded at 9.45 and left at 10.15. Served the worst breakfast and lunch. Arrived an hour late in Amsterdam. Had a 5 hour layover waiting to travel with KLM. Aircraft was a new Airbus A330-200. On time flight even arrived earlier in Toronto. Business class cabin was great. No PTVs though. This will be the first and last time I will fly Kenya Airways.,9th July 2013
338,"JNB-NBO in a 737. Plane arrived late took off late. Seating on the 737 a bit cramped for a flight of this distance. Served a late lunch fair quality. No IFE. No magazine in my seat pocket. Did not enjoy this trip. Nairobi airport 5 hour layover. Very poor airport to spend time in. Dark and gloomy. No seats to lie down in. Big Big wait to get food at the poor restaurant/snack place. Cold chicken pie could only manage a bit of it. You cannot even watch the planes arriving and leaving. Avoid NBO if longer than 1 hour. NBO-LHR on 777. OK economy fair. IFE very hard to work out and not a good choice. Dinner - fair at best. Breakfast before arrival very poor. Hard to get a second cup of coffee. Compares well to ""Ryanair"".",3rd July 2013
339,ADD-NBO-ADD. Both flights on time. Easy check in. Wonderful new aircraft the Embraer 190 lifts the whole experience above almost all medium haul flights in my entire life. I volunteered to downgrade on the ADD-NBO leg as the flight was sold out and I was only stand-by despite having a booking. However the ticket was issued for the following morning and I had the choice either to downgrade or to wait. But even the economy class was a very good experience despite being full: lots of food (2 food options + vegetarian) constant refill of drinks and the aircraft completely clean and staff observant and kind and quick. Not denied anything. On the way back same excellent service even the tax-free worked well. Very detailed enjoyable and interesting info from captain on both legs the entire cockpit staff was introduced and likewise the chief purser. Nice seats spacious with power-outlets. A great experience. IFE seemed not working but who cares?,26th May 2013
340,"They have repeatedly failed to deliver service befitting their alleged title as ""The Pride of Africa"". Sydney to Nairobi via Bangkok in April and December 2012 and the experience was appalling. KQ took over from BKK and FAs were very rude dismissive and rolled their eyes at simple and polite requests for essentials such as a blanket and water. When my first blanket request was ignored I pushed the FA button only for a passing FA to turn it off harshly and storm off while I was trying to explain what I needed. Eventually I gave up. There was no entertainment although this was a 15 or so hour flight! The seats were really uncomfortable and bathrooms were disgusting but I have to say the food was the only highlight. Never flying KQ again though.",28th April 2013
341,Flew from FBM to HKG it was pretty old 767 aircraft. Half of the entertainment system didn't work. Always afraid of whether the baggage will arrive or not. Uncomfortable seats. One of the flight attendant behaviour flying out was very impolite.,28th April 2013
342,Great overnight flight from LHR to Nairobi. On time. Delightful service. Good food. Generous with drinks. Only issue was shortish time between dinner and breakfast. Connection to Entebbe smooth. On time. New plane. Same quality of service. Baggage arrived. Absolutely no complaints.,18th April 2013
343,LHR-NBO-NDA Flew 17 Dec. Boarding was quick and efficient. Flight was delayed leaving Heathrow due to baggage needing to be taken off the plane because of no passengers. An understandable security measure and the pilot entertained us with his flight plan. Food was good and staff were friendly and attentive. Landed on time in Nairobi. Second leg to Ndola was uncomfortable. Seated in emergency exit aisle with very straight seat unable to recline. Seat slipped forward so the metal was exposed. Return leg via Nairobi was good. Seat for Nairobi to London was broken so would not stay reclined. IFE was good both ways as was all food and drink served.,29th January 2013
344,Nairobi to Bangkok. It was an overnight flight that was continuing to Guangzhou. An older aircraft entertainment system didn't work food was inedible. The staff however were delightful. Cheap tickets that got us to our destination - would definitely pay more in the future to avoid such an unpleasant experience.,29th January 2013
345,We travelled for the first time with Kenyan Airways and found staff very friendly and helpful. The food on board was adequate and hot. The seats were not very comfortable seat pitch poor and not much room. The return trip was on a newer aircraft I think and the onboard entertainment system worked fine.,24th January 2013
346,More than happy with the service from Malindi to Nairobi. The travel agent messed up my ticket and did not have the ticket available at the airport. They were kind and patient and even came on board to make sure I was fine I even was upgraded to business. It was such a short flight but the additional leg room was nice and seats were comfortable. Flight is only 40 minutes - time for a snack hot towel and soda.,7th January 2013
347,24 Dec 2012. Travelled KQ 484 from NBO-DAR. A midday flight we boarded quite early and waited a long time to depart. Embraer-190 was very clean and new had a delicious meal and arrived on-time and found our luggage. On our return flight boarded on-time and we left 10 minutes earlier than scheduled. The passengers seated in front of me fully lowered his seat which made me quite uncomfortable during both trips however the crew were kind.,3rd January 2013
348,Traveled to NBO on 31 Sep 2012. Flight delayed due to the fact that a jacket was found in a seat with no passenger attached to it. A few mumbled announcements were made to find the passenger. A security delay was announced followed by a need to re-fuel the aircraft before take-off. Many passengers missed their onward flights. Seats were incredibly uncomfortable. Felt like there was no padding and my seat cushion slipped forward revealing the metal base of the seat. Very uncomfortable. Inflight service did not work. No matter how many times they rebooted it certain seats were still no-ops. Headphones were falling apart and the one pair that was not was of no use as the socket on the seat I was sitting in and the one next to me was broken. The meal service was similar to what you would expect on a charter flight. Very basic breads cold to frozen and dry salad was tired and limp. I will not be flying KQ in futre unless I can pay for a C class ticket.,22nd November 2012
349,5 Nov 2012 KQ116 Nairobi to Amsterdam Boeing 767 Morning flight. I booked to fly KLM for both out and inbound journeys but unfortunately found myself obliged to fly KQ for the return seats and fittings equally dilapidated as the KQ flight to Paris that I now systematically avoid. Inflight entertainment was simply missing. I didn't think any airline would put these kind of flights on popular international routes. 2 hrs after take-off the breakfast trolley is rolling past 1 hour later flight attendant offers me a tray with bread croissant butter and juice announcing continental breakfast. Half an hour later I'm still waiting for a hot drink. In the meantime the captain is apologising about late take-off from Nairobi as if it was something to be proud of. Tea eventually comes 1 hour after 'continental breakfast'. Incidentally the temperatures in the cabin is kept glacial. This is nothing compared to lunch. After a terribly long wait to only to end up with a repeat of the earlier back and forth game of trolleys and trays partially empty trays trays with this or that missing. My salad comes with the inside of the already unsealed lid smeared with what looks like chocolate pudding? We are a long cry from the fancy looking menu proudly presented at the onset of flight. Between 2003 and 2007 KQ was my favourite company on this route but it will be a while before I choose KQ over other alternatives.,20th November 2012
350,I found the flight horrible. My partners T.V didn't work there and back). Seats not comfy when we called the flight attendant it was over an hour before anyone came that is after the bell was switched off several times. I was not sat with my partner and when I asked if it was possible if we could sit together they couldn't be bothered to help.,9th October 2012
351,Nairobi to Lagos after a 30 hours delay - yes 30 hours! But what was most annoying is that the Kenya Airways staff refused to explain what the problem was...was it mechanical or what? Turned out the cabin crew were staging industrial action to try to prevent non-Kenyan nationals working for the airline. But the refusal to explain anything only made passengers more and more angry. Never want to fly with them again.,8th October 2012
352,To be honest I never got on the airplane got to Nairobi for a flight to Lagos 05/10/2012 to be told the flight was cancelled and they had 'no spare airplanes'. We were told to 'try again the next day.' In the ensuing chaos business class passengers with confirmed ticket for another flight (Nairobi to Addis) were told the flight was overbooked and full already. The airline reflects the airport which is among the worst I've encountered.,4th October 2012
353,KQ is on time. I have flown them 12 times over the last few weeks ex. NBO to MBA and EBB and they are on time. Boarding commences at least 30 minutes before departure and you may have to sit on the plane for 15 minutes but all flights were in time. Flights have been very full. Service has been good (no food service just drinks) and priority luggage works. In EBB our bags were sitting near the conveyor belt having been off loaded first. Let's hope they can keep it up.,24th September 2012
354,We flew from Heathrow to Nairobi on 4th Sep with the flight leaving on time. We managed to get extra legroom seats (row 12) as my husband is 6 ft. 5 and they were fine. Boarding was fairly structured and the food (an evening meal - I chose the veggie option - stuffed peppers) was pretty good - hot and tasty with a snack just before landing for breakfast. I didn't expect much from the IFE from the reviews and wasn't bothered anyway. Some parts of the cabin were a bit frayed around the edges but no real complaints. Crew were fairly attentive. Both internal flights were also fine - a short hop between Nairobi and Mombassa and vice versa - the first left early the second a few minutes late. On both there was time for a snack and a drink with good crew service. Flying back on 13th from Nairobi to Heathrow was fine too - left on time but no extra legroom seats this time so a bit cramped for my husband. IFE was very poor - his seatback TV didn't work and mine was hit and miss. Again no complaints about food. Boarding this time was a bit more chaotic and JKIA is a horrible airport - cramped chaotic and poor flight information. Luggage all arrived with no problems too. Maybe we were just lucky given all the other poor experiences but I can't say there was anything majorly wrong with any of our flights or the service we received.,13th September 2012
355,Flew KQ return flight from CDG to NBI Aug20/Sep4. Flights were about on time. But very old run down 767 (worse than Delta) with pathetic seats/comfort and non-existent inflight entertainment. Staff looked bored and food was poor. With all this you'd expect a discount but no: 900 euros return and the plane was half empty on 20th.,13th September 2012
356,I was scheduled to fly from Chicago to Brussels and take Brussels Air to Nairobi. July 5th ORD flight was late missed connection re-routed through London London to Nairobi via Kenya Airlines. One checked bag did not arrive. Twice Kenya Air made arrangements to deliver bag while I was in country twice they failed to show. Repeated attempts to contact them after I returned were futile. Six weeks later United calls and says they have my bag.,10th September 2012
357,"Flew on a 767 from CDG to NBO on July 19th and then a 777 from NBO to AMS on August 17th. Flight from Paris to Nairobi showed as being ""on time"" for 11am departure but bit by bit departure was pushed back until 3pm without any explanation whatsoever. Once on board 767 both AVOD devices did not work making 8-hour journey feel even longer. Food was average (same as most US carriers) and service was kind. On return flight we were once again delayed for one hour without explanation and once again AVOD in both seats did not work. Food on return flight was less than pleasant. I did not have high expectations but Kenya Airways made even mainstream US carriers look luxurious.",28th August 2012
358,"I live in Kenya and I am a Flying Blue Gold member. Unfortunately I have to fly KQ frequently. I say ""unfortunately"" mainly due to the more than frequent delays without explanations without anyone responsible and without real support as to what to do. You feel totally lost in the horrible JKIA. When flights get delayed over night people are ferried to hotels in CBD instead of hotels closer to the airport. Apart from this standing joke on KQ unreliability of flights I have to say that I have always received my luggage (touch wood). In-flight entertainment is a complete joke with old movies on the system that only works half the time. Twice in business NBO-Paris I had no in-flight entertainment at all and no apologies for it. Food is not too bad. Seats are old and uncomfortable. Now if KQ would at least be a cheap airline I could accept all this but given the pricing structure it is just annoying. $1000 in Econ NBO to Maputo? I have seen worse but I have also seen much better.",28th August 2012
359,A pleasant surprise with this airline. I made sure I bought travel insurance and examined the policy wording after reading these reviews on this site. However from HKG-BKK-HKG it was clean efficient and with good service. Outbound flight delayed by 45 minutes but inward was on time. Luggage and check-in fast and efficient too (although couldn't check-in online). The price we paid made this a budget airline purchase effectively and we treated as such. Would be happy to fly with them again if we found a good deal.,16th August 2012
360,Flew them last month from Lusaka-Nairobi and return on old Boeing 767's. While going flight was via Lillongwe and on return via Harare. Both ways seats were broken and quite uncomfortable. Staff were not friendly at all. Cabin and toilets were quite dirty. Food both ways was also horrible. On return in Nairobi check-in staff gave me 2 boarding passes one for the Nairobi-Harare flight and the other for the Harare- Lusaka flight meaning I had to change seats in Harare! Never seen that in any other airline. Recommend to avoid this airline if possible and use alternatives when flying to and from Africa such as SAA/ET.,1st August 2012
361,"Flight from Nairobi to Kigali cancelled with no notice and no reason. Rebooked on later flight via Bujumbura. Stayed on the ground at Bujumburra for 2 hours. No luggage on arrival and no one cared. Phone call on a Saturday resulted in ""call back Monday we don't have staff to chase luggage on the weekend. In air service was good on all our Kenya Airways flights but poor schedule management and incredibly bad luggage management means I will not fly again if I can help it. Such a pity it could be a great airline.",25th July 2012
362,Flew Dubai to Nairobi to Dubai. Both ways cramped stuffy no IFE and filthy conditions. Also on return flight no reading light and arm rest broken. Flight from Nairobi to Dubai had been cancelled a month before but not informed. Staff made us feel that it was our fault. Kept waiting for hours before we could speak to someone in authority. No genuine interest shown by staff. Will not be using the Pride Of Kenya again.,9th July 2012
363,Flight to Johannesburg. Expected departure at 9.10 called KQ five minutes away from JKIA and informed of delayed departure (11.40). Checked in and informed of another delayed departure to 12 Noon. Boarded for departure at 12 noon Captain announces that we must wait for passengers connecting from New Delhi. Crew advise that they have no idea how long this will take. We finally depart at 12.40. KQ did not know that there were passengers arriving from New Delhi all along? The flight scheduled for 7am had not left thus passengers booked for this flight still stuck with everyone else. What exactly is happening - now informed that the Johannesburg-Nairobi 10.55 never actually exist and has never flown - but KQ will nevertheless book you on this flight and demand USD 80 for any attempt to change! Is this still the 'Pride' or the 'Embarrassment' of Africa in as far as this route is concerned. A number of Kenyans flying on this route frequently advise that you need to stay away from Kenya Airways. I hope that the return trip will be without delay.,3rd July 2012
364,I'm writing from the JKIA airport in Nairobi still stuck for 24 hours without any explanation from management. There was a 5 hour delay for all flights after that operations at the airport resumed to normal. But Kenya Airways kept telling us we would depart every 3 hours until 1am when passengers became angry and had to storm the First Class lounge of Kenya Airways so someone from Management could be called to explain the reason for the long delay. Needless to say no one showed up. Some passengers with children have been stuck at the airport for 2 days. Some passengers - not all have been given food. On average I would say that in the last 24 hours passengers have had 1 meal. Here we are paying $1100 from Nairobi to Accra but this service is pathetic.,6th June 2012
365,Checked in with seats assigned near the front. Trip from the Seychelles back to Nairobi for our connection back to LHR on BA. Boarded only to be told to forget the seat assignment it became an Easyjet / Ryanair fiasco. This happened on the Nairobi-Seychelles route too! I fly a lot and I must say the crew were without doubt the most miserable and rudest crew I've come across. On a positive note the food was quite good and the movie for a short flight was welcome the crew and boarding let the whole thing down. This was a 3 hour economy flight from Nairobi to Mahe both ways torn between yes and no for recommendation as pro's and cons.,1st May 2012
366,"Very disappointing indeed! As a Kenyan I wanted to believe that Kenya Airways is indeed the ""pride of Africa"". Perhaps it was at a time. Recently it is starting to be an ""embarrassment of Africa"". Service has deteriorated to poor levels. Our departure to Dubai was delayed for almost 3 hours. We were bundled out of the business lounge only to spend another hour waiting and without any Airline staff explaining the cause of delay or if indeed we were going to travel. They passed to and fro without having the courtesy to explain. My experience in the morning from Mombassa was a joke.",30th April 2012
367,"Update of my previous review. Rebooked flight out of Jo'burg at 11.15 on 17th April was cancelled with no advance notice sent. Customer Service not at all fazed by further inconvenience to passengers. Given access to lounge after a vigorous complaint. Today 27th April 2012 tried online check-in for return flight. Not too surprised to receive the message ""your reservation does not exist"". Called call centre in Nairobi only to be told my return reservation did not exist! Eventually it was resolved am now awaiting the ""right"" ticket by email.",27th April 2012
368,A nightmare out of Johannesburg on 16th April. Flight due to take off at 13.20 at 13.45 the Captain announced 9 passengers needed to disembark the aircraft in order to balance the load. A few passengers opted for the US$500 voucher in exchange for disembarking. However an hour later the aircraft hadn't moved. Chief FA then informs passengers that another 10 passengers have to be offloaded. Eventually all passengers had to disembark the aircraft and re-board so calculations could be reconciled with the regulations. At 16.30 after a frustrating 3 hour wait I voluntarily disembarked was taken to the baggage hall to collect my bag only to find all passengers’ baggage had not even been loaded onto the aircraft. Staff lied and tried to pass the buck at every opportunity. I have now been rebooked on 17th April and am not expecting a better show from KQ.,24th April 2012
369,Heathrow to Harare return. Outbound flight was okay with no delays and the flight was comfortable. Return flight was a nightmare we were delayed twice - once in Harare and Nairobi with no explanation for the delays.,20th April 2012
370,Nairobi to Lagos. Boarding procedures unpleasant sat in a window seat with a passenger next to me who had little appreciation of personal space and who loved what I was watching on my iPad. Food was great; took 3 requests to get a drink after food service finished. Would see if I could afford business class next time.,2nd April 2012
371,Have had very poor experiences in the past but Kenya Airways seems to be stepping up their game. Recent flights to Juba Addis Kigali Maputo and Joburg were all on time seats/planes were ok (new Embraer's are great) and service very good. Staff are almost always polite.,29th March 2012
372,Helpful crew but awful aeroplanes on LHR-NBO route in contrast to those internally used between Nairobi/Entebbe/Nairobi and Mombassa. Charming staff wheelchaired me onto flight from Entebbe to Nairobi and did the same to catch a plane on to Mombassa. Ground staff at Mombassa failed to explain luggage was ticketed through to LHR while of course on arrival in Kenya luggage is collected and then reinserted for an internal flight. Onboard 40f did not recline and the video did not work. A seat change produced a screen that worked and earphones with insufficient output to listen to the film. Misery on long flights.,16th March 2012
373,Fight from Kigali to Nairobi cancelled they gave me a flight the next day meaning I had to spend 24 hours in Kigali which I was transiting through. I missed two connections (Paris and Washington DC). They put me on a flight that required 8 hrs layover in Nairobi and refused to offer lounge access. The seat they gave me was by the exit arm rest was removed and I had to hold the tray table on my knees every time I needed it. A huge 767 no entertainment system. Food was as terrible as the service.,14th March 2012
374,Heathrow to Nairobi return. On time in both directions. Food OK going out but poor on return. IFE not working on outward journey. The B777 was very stuffy and with poor seats it was difficult to sleep. BA does this flight better.,9th March 2012
375,Heathrow to Nairobi return. On time in both directions. Food OK going out but poor on return. IFE not working on outward journey. The B777 was very stuffy and with poor seats it was difficult to sleep. BA does this flight better.,9th March 2012
376,When our flight was delayed due to the snow 3 weeks ago Kenya Airways couldn't have been more helpful. We were given breakfast and lunch vouchers a room in a hotel until we were able to fly later on in the day and buses were laid on to ferry us backwards and forwards from the terminal. Staff were courteous and helpful.,2nd March 2012
377,Heathrow to Nairobi return. Business cabin comfortable and food good. Staff charming and helpful. Cabin can get very stuffy. Daylight flight preferable. Very happy to travel KA again.,2nd March 2012
378,Five of us travelled from Nairobi to Mombassa return. What can you say about a 45 mins flight take off seat ok drink served with polite crew.,27th February 2012
379,LHR-NBO return. Economy in uncomfortable and cramped seats that made sleep impossible. In different seats for outward and inbound flights but inflight entertainment system was broken on both legs. B777 fairly modern but worn buttons on the entertainment system suggested it had been broken for some time. Cabin staff promised to come back but never did. Later used crew call button but this was ignored. Food was poor with breakfast just a bread roll and jam. Cramped hot and stuffy Nairobi airport wasn't much fun either.,27th February 2012
380,Have returned recently from Mombassa - outbound journey not as bad as last year. Seats still very uncomfortable. Internal flights via Nairobi to Mombassa - crew were helpful and happy. Not so on our night flight back to the UK crew rude and unhelpful. Inedible food.,24th February 2012
381,Comoros (HAH) to Johannesburg (JNB) via Nairobi (NBO). A terrible experience - firstly check-in in Comoros is chaotic. Secondly I and about 6 others were downgraded from Business to Economy Class without apology or explanation. Thirdly I and the other downgraded passengers had to search around the crowded economy cabin to find a spare seat - cabin crew did not show any interest sympathy and did not help.,22nd February 2012
382,LHR to NBO and Juba return. Excellent flights in both directions. 777-200 on LHR-NBO legs with comfortable if slightly worn lie flat beds. Excellent cabin service throughout. NBO-Juba in new EMB 170 in economy but good food and drinks. Faultless service despite the chaos of Juba airport.,17th February 2012
383,NBO-AMS. Checked in on-line baggage drop very efficient. B777-200 with relatively new interior and functioning IFE. Flight left on time and arrived in AMS 30 mins early. Cabin crew were friendly and informative. The food was well-seasoned and hot drinks available throughout. Arrival in AMS was smooth and I had my baggage within 10 mins of landing. It is unfortunate that KQ is unable to provide this experience every single time. That accounts for the low ratings and terrible reviews.,15th February 2012
384,Frequent traveller between NBO-EBB. Good mannered and helpful staff. Left 10 mins ahead of schedule and arrived on time. This is unique given frequent delays on this route. Will the improvement hold?,15th February 2012
385,LHR to NBO. Boeing 777 could feel the seat framework through the upholstery IFE didn't work entire control unit in armrest out of action so when the cabin lights were switched off at 10pm I couldn't even switch the light on to read my book. Cabin staff unhelpful and surly. Drinks only offered with meals so only twice on a 9 hour flight. Return flight also 777 different experience completely - staff nice seats fine IFE worked came round with drinks several times. Internal flights from Nairobi to Mombasa and return were fine.,6th February 2012
386,LHR to Nairobi. Flight left on time and arrived early. Seat 31 back row but only 2 seats were comfortable enough and reclined ok. Food very good and FA's good. Night flight so not bothered about IFE. Return left on time and arrived early. Food not so good. Same excellent seats. All in all very pleasantly surprised after reading some awful comments. Would use again.,6th February 2012
387,"Johannesburg to Nairobi. Check-in at Oliver Tambo is a disaster. I had checked in online but despite this I had to check-in at the machine as well as the check-in counter. The printout from the online check-in as well as the boarding pass printed by the machine are both promptly torn up by the check-in agent who then prints the ""final"" boarding pass. Trolleys are not allowed in the queues ""for security reasons"" when all other airlines operating from the same terminal allow trolleys to be pushed right up to the check-in counter. Flight itself is poor. Old aircraft with many broken seats and badly trained staff.",3rd February 2012
388,Johannesburg from London. Fairly easy to book and good at check-in. Food served on London-Nairobi trip was awful - the local Ugali was served. This is not something you serve unless fresh and especially not on an airline. We were delayed disembarking in Nairobi we waited on the tarmac for the buses to take us to the terminal! Worse was that it was a cold night. Would not recommend this airline in its current state. It needs urgent and drastic overhaul.,2nd February 2012
389,"London to Nairobi was an OK experience from there it went right down hill! Arrived at Nairobi to the news that my onward connection to Kigali had been cancelled; so an extended stay at the worst ""international"" airport I have ever been in. Combine that with less than helpful staff made for a very miserable 4.5 hours. Onward flight was in a modern comfortable airplane but no compensation for the ""Nairobi Experience"". Will definitely be seeking an alternative route next time.",31st January 2012
390,From Nairobi to Addis Ababa via Djibouti. I must say that was the worst flight that I have ever been on. The seats didn't recline enough for one to say that they were in business class. The seating was just uncomfortable and the seats were small. The cabin crew helped by providing a fairly good service. Other then that the flight was just a drag and when I landed in Addis Ababa my back was hurting. That was my first and definitely last time flying with Kenya Airways.,28th January 2012
391,Flew from Kenya to Bangkok. Service and food was good. IFE was below average half the channels did not work. The bathrooms at least this time had enough toilet paper and hand towels. Service has a long way to go before it reaches other airline levels. Jomo Kenyatta a very old and tired airport.,26th January 2012
392,KGL via BJM. Well timed flights good aircraft's - operated an embraer 190 jet new and comfortable. Had a hot breakfast with an option of chicken beef and veggie. The crew were young and friendly captain kept us well informed on reports on turbulence.,20th January 2012
393,London Heathrow to Nairobi on Christmas Day. The flight was cancelled and we flew the following morning. We were left in a fair amount of chaos only by following other passengers did we find our way out of the airport to the Heathrow Hilton our luggage was left overnight in the hold. The Hilton had more or less run out of food there was one representative from the airline at the hotel reception to inform us of what was happening the following day. Once onboard the food was awful stale breakfast when we should have had lunch (the food from the previous day) screens for entertainment didn't work. On our return flight the loos were blocked awful food. This airline really needs to raise its game.,12th January 2012
394,Business class between Nairobi and Heathrow good both ways. Charming staff comfortable seats and a great effort to provide food for a gluten free vegetarian! Flights on time. Entertainment limited but overall pleasantly surprised.,12th January 2012
395,LHR-NBO Economy. Sat on the plane for 3hrs at LHR while recurrent electrical problem was fixed they kept us well informed of the situation but it turned an 8hr flight into an 11hr journey. All the negatives are well documented here my conclusion pay the extra for BA or VS or if you have time Emirates via Dubai. Economy product isn't up to much. NBO-LHR Business. Paid for a last minute upgrade at NBO Business cabin is light and airy with only 28 seats on the 777-200 with the cabin half empty. Comfortable fully adjustable chair which turns into a 75 inch flat bed meals served on china and of a good quality and drinks readily available. Only gripe is the awful AVOD. At $500 for the upgrade I felt this represented value for money and such a far cry from the outbound horrors in economy.,10th January 2012
396,LHR-NBO-HRE. Flight from London to Nairobi was terrible barely enough leg room the entertainment system did not work and the crew was rude and offish. Flight from Nairobi to Harare was much better although there was no inflight entertainment. Overall I would only recommend this airline if the flight is intra-continental rather than intercontinental.,9th January 2012
397,DAR-NBO-AMS. Both flights departed on time. However staff on both flights were not particularly friendly or thoughtful - what a difference with our inward flight to Nairobi with KLM. Food on NBO-AMS was a disappointment with dry buns for breakfast and a salad for lunch. Received one drink directly after take off but after that no more refreshments for 5 hours. Flight entertainment system on the 8 hrs NBO-AMS flight was not working - system spontaneously reset itself several times during the flight or it didn't work at all. Overall very disappointing and what a shame that Kenya Airways is a code sharing partner of KLM.,9th January 2012
398,NBO to Accra. To my surprise flight was overbooked. Many who had tickets could not fly. Flight itself was pleasant with friendly attendants. Food ok. Seat on the aisle next to exit could not recline though legroom was good. However this was shattered when our luggage was left - many passengers affected. Almost 2 hours waiting in line in Accra just to report this. 3 days down the line still waiting. Good airline but becoming sloppy.,24th December 2011
399,Nairobi to Harare in business class on a new Embraer 190s. Excellent aircraft for regional flights. Individual touch screens with limited choice of movies and music but sufficient given the length of the journey. Quite good food and very friendly crew but they left behind over 100 passengers luggage in Nairobi including mine. No airline staff were available no compensation and rather unprofessional handling agent at Harare airport. Nairobi airport - probably ok in 1980s but was crowded dirty and not up to standards for 2011.,1st December 2011
400,NBO-AMS. Departure time was 8.10am but just before takeoff we had to go back to the gate to switch planes which took a good 3 hrs. Flight took off around 12pm. Crew did not provide any refreshments during the 4 hr delay. Onboard crew were rude and seemed disinterested in serving passengers. The food was fair the entertainment was not working. The crew seemed more interested in chit chatting at the back on the plane than serving us. Overall I was totally dissatisfied with this airline.,1st December 2011
401,Melbourne to Zambia via Bangkok through Nairobi. Flight from Bangkok to Nairobi was delayed without any apologies or explanation. Flight attendants were not friendly and not even a smile from them. I asked for some headphones and 4 hours later I reminded her and she just threw them at me. My flight from Nairobi to Lusaka was also delayed without any apologies again. My return trip was the same.,18th November 2011
402,LHR-NB0-HRE return - B777 and B737-800. The aircraft was modern but seemed a bit tired inside the cabin. Boarding was efficient from LHR but chaotic at NBO the IFE had very limited choices. The cabin crew were semi efficient but at times seemed rude however I found the meals to be good and their complimentary gifts for my kids made for a pleasant flights indeed. Seating and legroom is fair. Overall a decent airline I would use again.,10th November 2011
403,London to Nairobi the worst airline I have ever used. Departure delayed by more than 12 hours. Almost no staff to help us. Rude unsmiling and unhelpful when they did appear. Inflight entertainment didn't work on the way out or on the return flight a week later. Food awful. No legroom either.,31st October 2011
404,Amsterdam-Nairobi. Flight left and arrived on time food despite not looking appetising actually quite tasty. Staff relatively efficient. Seat back entertainment didn't work properly seemed to be hit and miss for most passengers. I'm 5ft 10 and I found seating on the 767 to be incredibly cramped much more so than the return flight on KLM. That and the position of the entertainment box under my B seat made it physically impossible to find a position in which to sleep.,24th October 2011
405,As per the previous review I was traveling on the cancelled 2345 flight from Nairobi to Heathrow as part of a round trip. The flights in both directions were reasonably good the entertainment systems were broken for most of the seats but staff were pleasant and helpful and food was good. Unfortunately the reaction to the cancelled flight was awful and the worst treatment I have ever received from an airline. As the previous reviewer says the staff were very slow extremely ill informed and seem to have lied on occasion. Almost no effort was made to inform passengers as to what they needed to do in terms of changing flights getting back through immigration control and sorting out a hotel. This resulted in a great deal of frustration and wasted time queuing in the wrong places. In particular the airline made very little effort to help passengers find hotel accommodation; only one member of staff was available to help and passengers including us were told that there was no hotel accommodation left available which was later proved to be untrue when a number of passengers complained and were miraculously found hotel rooms. I suspect the lack of hotel rooms may have related rather more to a lack of appetite to pay the room rates rather than any genuine shortage. Ultimately we along with perhaps a third of the passengers ended up sleeping on the floor of the transit lounge until we were told to get up and move at around 6am. The re-scheduled flight was then further delayed when the first officer did not turn up for work at this point refreshments were provided but not enough for all the passengers. All in all a consistent and depressing display of incompetence.,23rd October 2011
406,Nairobi-LHR. I recently was unfortunate to have flown Kenya Airways. Flying Nairobi to Heathrow on the 23.45 flight we were told after we had all proceeded through the gate that it had been cancelled. This was at midnight. 2 staff were available to book over 200 people onto new flights. They were slow rude and lied about when they were able to do. They were very slow to provide any refreshments and were not able to accommodate everyone in hotels until the flights the following day - so we had to sleep on the floor. When I finally got a flight home the food was substandard the staff were rude and surly. Toilets were not cleaned or maintained. I will never be flying this airline again.,22nd October 2011
407,"Antananarivo to Nairobi flight. Arrived at Ivato airport to be told flight cancelled. Check in staff had no idea why or when they would be able to get me to Nairobi. ""On the next flight"" they said. ""When will that be?"" I asked. ""I don't know. In the next few days"" was the reply. I was sent to the Carlton Hotel to wait to be recalled. At hotel discovered that a room had been booked for me for four nights! However message received at hotel to be ready for transport to airport the next day at 8.00am. Arrived at Ivato 8.30am check-in didn't open till 10.15am. Once checked in to Nairobi I was casually told that my London connection was booked for two days later. After some minutes of discussion they transferred me to that evening's London connection (which involves nine hours in Nairobi airport!).",19th October 2011
408,LHR to Nairobi. Punctual departure and arrival. Clean spacious 777 good leg room. Inflight entertainment not working. Food: lamb stew with very overcooked veg -- second rate school dinners. Completely unsmiling cabin crew who knocked my arm (I was in an aisle seat) every time they passed. Loos not tidied or cleaned during flight (8.5 hours).,19th October 2011
409,I write this sitting in an airport lounge having just disembarked from the only trip that I have ever taken using Kenya Airways - it is awful! The outbound flight there was no individual entertainment system just a single main screen movie that was impossible to watch. The seats were uncomfortable. Food awful and not enough. The return flight used a newer aircraft but that only meant that the seats were even closer together making it a long and painful trip. Even though the newer aircraft had individual entertainment system it was lacking features and mine did not work. They could not even turn it off so that I could sleep so I had this white screen glaring at me all through the night. The crew are poor - 10 minutes before landing I asked what terminal we would arrive at and they did not know. If you have a choice to use another airline then please do.,14th October 2011
410,"Good points are that we left on time and boarding was well organised. Service onboard was awful. On both flights the entertainment system was not working and despite asking over and over again no one had the courtesy to come back to me. On the outward flight the service was a disgrace - no drink for an hour then it came with the meal. I had asked twice for a drink and was told ""2 minutes"". The plane was tired - carpets rucked up and loose seats dirty and stained.",30th September 2011
411,Flights delayed. No customer service and poor communication. Sullen and unhelpful staff. Passengers were treated more like cattle and staff acted more like those of a budget airline.,13th September 2011
412,Check in was chaotic and the ground manager seemed more concerned about whether the flight was full than the brusque attitude of the check-in staff even at Business check-in. Onboard the seats were comfortable and the service of the business crew was attentive without being over powering. The drinks were flowing the food high quality with an excellent breakfast. The journey was smooth. The blanket could have been better and the utility set was not to the standard I would expect from Business. The entertainment was ok but there was insufficient choice. Enjoyed the flight but still improvements that could be made.,13th September 2011
413,FIH-NBO-CDG. All flights on time I was surprised that they did not make any welcome announcements before takeoff very unusual. Food was great on the first leg (737-800) service was quick and efficient. The Nairobi Jomo Kenyatta airport is getting better every day with new seating areas. Boarding was slow on the Paris flight food good with a new KQ menu a nice touch for Economy Class passengers. The cabin was however too cold so passengers did not have a good night sleep. Good flights overall and friendly staff.,12th September 2011
414,NBO-AMS. Plane scheduled to leave at 8.10am. At 12pm no boarding no announcement. Passengers started asking questions and an announcement came that the crew had not arrived. We ended up leaving more than 7hrs later. The TV on the plane did not work making an already 8 hr long journey almost unbearable.,23rd August 2011
415,LHR - NBO return on a B777. Departed and arrived on time. No problems with bags. The food was average with a full meal followed later by a snack going to NBO. On the trip north a small snack at the start of the trip and a small breakfast at the end. The cabin crew was fine. The plane was in good condition. The entertainment system had limited range of programs. The only major issue was the boarding procedure at Nairobi airport. The passengers were squeezed into a tiny departure lounge for a long time. The boarding process was a mess with announcements and ground staff contradicting each other. I would happily use them again.,22nd August 2011
416,NBO-AMS on B777. Mixed experience. We were almost 1 hr late departing Nairobi with no explanations or apologies. Arrived in AMS almost on time. Breakfast was average with a hot lunch which was quite good. IFE was a bit unstable but kept me entertained. Had an onwards connection in AMS with KLM-CPH that I made but my luggage didn't. Delivered next day at my home in Copenhagen.,15th August 2011
417,JNB-NBO. Cabin crew were warm and friendly. Food was very good IFE was average but they can do much better. The duty free was surprisingly good.,14th August 2011
418,Nairobi to LDN. Economy Seat 33C and 24B. Boarding a little chaotic and some sat in the boarding lounge for 90 mins. Staff were sufficiently attentive. Food adequate. AV worked and toilets very clean. Arrived on time. Seating 24B was very poor no leg room and uncomfortable. Moved to 33C aisle seat limited recline and impossible to sleep. Avoid KQ Economy long haul short haul however is good.,9th August 2011
419,Antanatarivo to Niarobi. 4 hr flight left on time. Service was good and cabin staff attentive. Food was average with ok leg room. Cabin and toilets clean. First time on KQ and was pleasantly surprised. However this was shorthaul - longhaul experience was awful.,9th August 2011
420,We were quite disappointed by our first experience of Kenya Airways on our recent trip from London to Nairobi - my husband's TV wasn't working and although we asked for help that was simply ignored. The staff looked bored and were not very attentive. You had to be quick to say that you wanted coffee/tea as you only had one chance much too early during dinner. The food wasn't great but edible. I was also annoyed by the fact that they didn't encourage other passengers to put their seats forward when food was served - that meant we had even less space whilst having our breakfast. The flight back was not quite as bad but still I felt the staff could have made more of an effort (occasional smile would be nice). The thing I would really like to criticise was the boarding procedure at Nairobi airport - we were asked to board 1.5 hours before departure which meant that we were squeezed into a tiny departure lounge for that length of time - the boarding was a mess with the announcements and ground staff contradicting each other - despite the early 'boarding time' we still managed to leave late.,7th August 2011
421,Cabin crew in Economy not very communicative. They seem to forget it is their job to be polite and helpful. Flying in Economy is stressful especially when most of the time the entertainment system doesn't work toilets are left dirty towards the end of the flight and if you want duty free items you have to watch for when they come by or you will miss them. Food was awful with very limited choice. Tea and coffee service is poor.,4th August 2011
422,Flew KQ in Business NBO-JNB using points. We were on the 8pm flight. Check in was very easy with no queue. The lounge in NBO is small and crowded. We boarded by bus (cram as many people in as you can). On board (737-800) only 5/16 seats occupied. Food was good. There was one starter (no choice) choice of 2 main courses and then desert or cheese (pre-plated). Wine was excellent. Service was good. Glasses were always topped up. We never use KQ IFE. Always carry our own iPad and BOSE noise cancelling headphones. KQ gave a basic amenity kit. Arrival into JNB was 30 mins early. Luggage took 15 mins to come out. Overall pleasant experience.,1st August 2011
423,It was a Mombasa-Nairobi flight schedule to leave at 1440h so we arrived at the airport by 1315h and checked in they did not say one word to us about the delay. They didn't tell us anything but simply put it up on the board after we had waited for 2 hrs already without any announcement or explanation. Of course it did not leave until 1840h. KQ will allow you to book and check in then they will not service the flight leaving you effectively grounded and waiting for up to 5 hrs for a local flight. Pure inefficiency.,1st August 2011
424,LHR-NBO. Had read on here from many posters that the IFE is grossly unreliable and not surprisingly I struck the same with the entire side of the plane without IFE. No compensation but not=too bothered as was an overnight flight and I slept. Arrival procedure in Nairobi bordering on chaotic with visa process etc and baggage hall a shambles but not fault of airline. Having made the choice over BA/VS to see something different I was satisfied staff were surprisingly good.,31st July 2011
425,The seats were neat and clean and food was excellent. Our flight from Johannesburg to Nairobi couldn't land at Nairobi. The plane landed at Mombasa where passengers were kept in the airport for 4 hrs without food/water. Kenyan Airways and Airport staff were not able to manage angry passengers. We were taken to Nairobi the next morning. I missed all my schedules. Staffs are not prepared they lack co-ordination with each other.,27th July 2011
426,Staff completely uninterested and uninformed especially ground staff who upon being confronted with the slightest challenge turn their back and leave. Always delays very filthy toilets overpriced tickets especially within Africa. Business class lounge is average.,25th July 2011
427,NBO-FIH. Check-in at the Jomo Kenyatta airport was slow as usual with long lines starting outside the terminal. Flight on time on a 767-300 for some reason IFE was not available but I did not mind as the flight was 3 hrs. A nice hot breakfast was served after take off by a very friendly almost all male cabin crew. Great flight overall  with good standards and professional crew for an African airline.,25th July 2011
428,"London to Nairobi - excellent flight good service comfortable seat decent leg room (I am 5'10"") food could be better good entertainment system. I would happily use them again. Onward to Mombassa also fine delayed coming back at Mombassa - not airlines fault - but connection held and most of time made up and free refreshments when delayed so overall did well despite difficulties.",22nd July 2011
429,JNB-NBO-JNB. This trip showed both the good and average sides of this airline. JNB-NBO was on time in-flight service was good and the 737-800 used was clean and comfortable. NBO-JNB was a different story. Upon arrival at Nairobi Airport I was informed that I had been re-booked on a later flight instead. As a result the boarding process took a long time and the flight was delayed about 30mins. The 767 used on this leg was in good shape with a smart blue leather interior and a good seat pitch. The IFE was a bit dated with the old-style projector. Meal choices were a bit odd for breakfast but the service was prompt.,18th July 2011
430,"Nairobi-London. Lounge in Nairobi was small and food poor but for Nairobi Airport standards it was ok. Very surprised they only started boarding 25mins before departure (usually it's much earlier) but we managed to leave bang on time. Welcome by Cabin Crew was warm. Seat was comfortable in sitting position. Seat nice and wide. When converted into a bed it's angle is 170 degrees but you can't stretch your legs fully (and I'm only 5'8) which means any position for a long period of time is uncomfortable. In flight entertainment was poor - AVOD but very limited selection of films. Lots of features seemed to be broken - whether it was the control or the individual system it was unclear. Food was a mixture - lunch was excellent beautifully presented but the Afternoon tea (which they copied it seems from BA) was appalling - sandwiches were dry rolls with slabs of butter and unidentifiable filling. Scone was cold and dry. Cabin Crew were good but not excellent - they were courteous and warm but very slow which was disappointing as the cabin was almost empty so they had only a few passengers to serve and it still took an age for them to respond to any request or to complete each round of the meal service. I would be very frustrated if the cabin had been full. Disappointingly there was absolutely no interaction with pax from crew. Overall the flight was reasonably comfortable and smooth but not good value for money. As it was an award ticket I can't complain too much but I would certainly not pay a Business Class fare for the ""Premium"" product Kenya Airways offers.",17th July 2011
431,Nairobi-London. As me and my wife are both wheelchair passengers (for which we charged $10 each by the Nairobi office it was a very disappointing experience at London Heathrow. There were no wheelchairs on arrival at Heathrow. I had to wait 40 mins before the ground staff could arrange for a wheelchair or a buggy. In the end we had to walk half the distance with one wheel chair for me (no wheel chair for my wife! although $10 was paid). There was no inflight entertainment I tried to talk to the purser but he/she did not bother. We have flown Kenya Airways many times and competition airlines as well. Seems that the airline in looking for profits is ignoring the comfort of passengers (although a shareholder of the company I do not expect the service to be comprised) to support our national airline. Another area I would like to point out is no refresher kit is given to Economy Class passengers. If I had known we would have brought ours and create profit for the airline.,11th July 2011
432,LUN-LLW in Economy. Adequate for a 1 hr trip. FA were friendly; there was a quick distribution of nuts and drinks; and PTVs. I've always found that you when you ask for a canned drink you get given two of them - a small touch that I've always liked.,6th July 2011
433,I fly Kenya very often (almost once every 2 weeks) and usually Business on the route Nairobi-Mombasa. I find the staff (both ground and flight attendants) quite friendly. The aircraft are usually in good condition usually ex KLM 737s. The domestic flight food quality is quite poor. The real problem with KQs domestic flight is the lack of a lounge in the domestic side. JKIA is KQs hub but it looks more like an outdated bus terminal. Nairobi needs urgently a new airport.,4th July 2011
